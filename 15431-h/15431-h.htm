    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lonely station of Manzanita stood out, sharp and unsightly, in the
      keen February sunlight. A mile away in a dip of the desert, lay the town,
      a sorry sprawl of frame buildings, patternless save for the one main
      street, which promptly lost itself at either end in a maze of cholla,
      prickly pear, and the lovely, golden-glowing roseo. Far as the eye could
      see, the waste was spangled with vivid hues, for the rare rains had come,
      and all the cacti were in joyous bloom, from the scarlet stain of the
      ocatilla to the pale, dream-flower of the yucca. Overhead the sky shone
      with a hard serenity, a blue, enameled dome through which the imperishable
      fires seemed magnified as they limned sharp shadows on the earth; but in
      the southwest clouds massed and lurked darkly for a sign that the storm
      had but called a truce.
    </p>
    <p>
      East to west, along a ridge bounding the lower desert, ran the railroad, a
      line as harshly uncompromising as the cold mathematics of the engineers
      who had mapped it. To the north spread unfathomably a forest of scrub pine
      and piñon, rising, here and there, into loftier growth. It was as if man,
      with his imperious interventions, had set those thin steel parallels as an
      irrefragable boundary to the mutual encroachments of forest and desert,
      tree and cactus. A single, straggling trail squirmed its way into the
      woodland. One might have surmised that it was winding hopefully if blindly
      toward the noble mountain peak shimmering in white splendor, mystic and
      wonderful, sixty miles away, but seeming in that lucent air to be brooding
      closely over all the varied loveliness below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though nine o&rsquo;clock had struck on the brisk little station-clock,
      there was still a tang of night chill left. The station-agent came out,
      carrying a chair which he set down in the sunniest corner of the platform.
      He looked to be hardly more than a boy, but firm-knit and self-confident.
      His features were regular, his fairish hair slightly wavy, and in his
      expression there was a curious and incongruous suggestion of settledness,
      of acceptance, of satisfaction with life as he met it, which an observer
      of men would have found difficult to reconcile with his youth and the
      obvious intelligence of the face. His eyes were masked by deeply browned
      glasses, for he was bent upon literary pursuits, witness the corpulent,
      paper-covered volume under his arm. Adjusting his chair to the angle of
      ease, he tipped back against the wall and made tentative entry into his
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a monumental work was that in the treasure-filled recesses of which
      the young explorer was straightway lost to the outer world! No human need
      but might find its contentment therein. Spread forth in its alluringly
      illustrated pages was the whole universe reduced to the purchasable. It
      was a perfect and detailed microcosm of the world of trade, the cosmogony
      of commerce <i>in petto</i>. The style was brief, pithy, pregnant; the
      illustrations&mdash;oh, wonder of wonders!&mdash;unfailingly apt to the
      text. He who sat by the Damascus Road of old marveling as the caravans
      rolled dustily past bearing &ldquo;emeralds and wheat, honey and oil and
      balm, fine linen and embroidered goods, iron, cassia and calamus, white
      wool, ivory and ebony,&rdquo; beheld or conjectured no such wondrous
      offerings as were here gathered, collected, and presented for the
      patronage of this heir of all the ages, between the gay-hued covers of the
      great Sears-Roebuck Semiannual Mail-Order Catalogue. Its happy possessor
      need but cross the talisman with the ready magic of a postal money order
      and the swift genii of transportation would attend, servile to his call,
      to deliver the commanded treasures at his very door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young reader was not purposefully shopping in this vast
      market-place of print. Rather he was adventuring idly, indulging the
      amateur spirit, playing a game of hit-or-miss, seeking oracles in those
      teeming pages. Therefore he did not turn to the pink insert, embodying the
      alphabetical catalogue (Abdominal Bands to Zither Strings), but opened at
      random.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supertoned Banjos,&rdquo; he read, beginning at the heading; and,
      running his eye down the different varieties, paused at &ldquo;Pride of
      the Plantation, a full-sized, well-made, snappy-toned instrument at a very
      moderate price. 12 T 4031/4.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The explorer shook his head. Abovestairs rested a guitar (the Pearletta,
      12 S 206, price $7.95) which he had purchased at the instance of Messrs.
      Sears-Roebuck&rsquo;s insinuating representation as set forth in catalogue
      item 12 S 01942, &ldquo;Self-mastery of the Guitar in One Book, with All
      Chords, Also Popular Solos That Can Be Played Almost at Sight.&rdquo; The
      nineteen-cent instruction-book had gone into the fire after three days of
      unequal combat between it and its owner, and the latter had subsequently
      learned something of the guitar (and more of life) from a Mexican-American
      girl with lazy eyes and the soul of a capricious and self-indulged kitten,
      who had come uninvited to Manzanita to visit an aunt, deceased six months
      previously. With a mild pang of memory for those dreamy, music-filled
      nights on the desert, the youth decided against further experiments in
      stringed orchestration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telescopes turned up next. He lingered a moment over 20 T 3513, a
      nickel-plated cap pocket-glass, reflecting that with it he could discern
      any signal on the distant wooded butte occupied by Miss Camilla Van
      Arsdale, back on the forest trail, in the event that she might wish a wire
      sent or any other service performed. Miss Camilla had been very kind and
      understanding at the time of the parting with Carlotta, albeit with a
      grimly humorous disapproval of the whole inflammatory affair; as well as
      at other times; and there was nothing that he would not do for her. He
      made a neat entry in a pocket ledger (3 T 9901) against the time when he
      should have spare cash, and essayed another plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arctics and Lumberman&rsquo;s Overs he passed by with a grin as
      inappropriate to the climate. Cod Liver Oil failed to interest him, as did
      the Provident Cast Iron Range and the Clean-Press Cider Mill. But he
      paused speculatively before Punching Bags, for he had the clean pride of
      body, typical of lusty Western youth, and loved all forms of exercise.
      Could he find space, he wondered, to install 6 T 1441 with its Scientific
      Noiseless Platform &amp; Wall Attachment (6 T 1476) in the portable house
      (55 S 17) which, purchased a year before, now stood in the clearing behind
      the station crammed with purchases from the Sears-Roebuck wonderbook.
      Anyway, he would make another note of it. What would it be like, he
      wondered, to have a million dollars to spend, and unlimited access to the
      Sears-Roebuck treasures. Picturing himself as such a Croesus, he
      innocently thought that his first act would be to take train for Chicago
      and inspect the warehoused accumulations of those princes of trade with
      his own eager eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      He mused humorously for a moment over a book on &ldquo;Ease in
      Conversation.&rdquo; (&ldquo;No trouble about conversation,&rdquo; he
      reflected; &ldquo;the difficulty is to find anybody to converse with,&rdquo;
      and he thought first of Carlotta, and then of Miss Camilla Van Arsdale,
      but chiefly of the latter, for conversation had not been the strong point
      of the passionate, light-hearted Spanish girl.) Upon a volume kindly
      offering to teach astronomy to the lay mind without effort or trouble (43
      T 790) and manifestly cheap at $1.10, he bestowed a more respectful
      attention, for the desert nights were long and lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually he arrived at the department appropriate to his age and the
      almost universal ambition of the civilized male, to wit, clothing. Deeply,
      judiciously, did he meditate and weigh the advantages as between 745 J 460
      (&ldquo;Something new&mdash;different&mdash;economical&mdash;efficient. An
      all-wool suit embodying all the features that make for clothes
      satisfaction. This announcement is of tremendous importance&rdquo;&mdash;as
      one might well have inferred from the student&rsquo;s rapt expression) and
      776 J 017 (&ldquo;A double-breasted, snappy, yet semi-conservative effect
      in dark-green worsted, a special social value&rdquo;), leaning to the
      latter because of a purely literary response to that subtle and deft
      appeal of the attributive &ldquo;social.&rdquo; The devotee of Messrs.
      Sears-Roebuck was an innately social person, though as yet his gregarious
      proclivities lay undeveloped and unsuspected by himself. Also he was of a
      literary tendency; but of this he was already self-conscious. He passed on
      to ulsters and raincoats, divagated into the colorful realm of neckwear,
      debated scarf-pins and cuff-links, visualized patterned shirtings, and
      emerged to dream of composite sartorial grandeurs which, duly synthesized
      into a long list of hopeful entries, were duly filed away within the pages
      of 3 T 9901, the pocket ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps shuffling along the right of way dispelled his visions. He
      looked up to see two pedestrians who halted at his movement. They were
      paired typically of that strange fraternity, the hobo, one being a
      grizzled, hard-bitten man of waning middle age, the other a vicious and
      scrawny boy of eighteen or so. The boy spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You the main guy here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a sore throat?&rdquo; demanded the boy surlily. He started
      toward the door. The agent made no move, but his eyes were attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be near enough,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we ain&rsquo;t on that lay,&rdquo; put in the grizzled man. He
      was quite hoarse. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t to be scared of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; agreed the agent. And, indeed, the fact was
      self-evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the pueblo yonder?&rdquo; asked the man with a jerk of
      his head toward the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hoosegow is old and the sheriff is new.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got ya,&rdquo; said the man, nodding. &ldquo;We better be on our
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hell of a guy, you are,&rdquo; whined the boy.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On yer way&rsquo; from you an&rsquo; not so much as &lsquo;Are
      you hungry?&rsquo; What about a little hand-out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tightwad! How&rsquo;d you like&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hungry, feel in your coat-pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re a wise one,&rdquo; put in the man, grinning
      appreciatively. &ldquo;We got grub enough. Panhandlin&rsquo;s a habit with
      the kid; don&rsquo;t come natural to him to pass a likely prospect without
      makin&rsquo; a touch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the platform, raising one foot slightly from the ground
      in the manner of a limping animal. The agent disappeared into the station,
      locking the door after him. The boy gave expression to a violent obscenity
      directed upon the vanished man. When that individual emerged again, he
      handed the grizzled man a box of ointment and tossed a packet of tobacco
      to the evil-faced boy. Both were quick with their thanks. That which they
      had most needed and desired had been, as it were, spontaneously provided.
      But the elder of the wayfarers was puzzled, and looked from the salve-box
      to its giver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know my feet was blistered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been padding in the rain, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been on the hoof, too?&rdquo; asked the hobo quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s Banneker.
      Are you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of you three years ago when you was down on the Long Line
      Sandy,&rdquo; said the man. He paused and considered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      your lay, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; he asked, curiously but respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see it. Railroading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gay-cat,&rdquo; put in the boy with a touch of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold your fresh lip,&rdquo; his elder rebuked him. &ldquo;This
      gent has treated us <i>like</i> a gent. But why? What&rsquo;s the idea?
      That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, some day I might want to run for Governor on the hobo ticket,&rdquo;
      returned the unsmiling agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get our votes. Well, so long and much obliged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two resumed their journey. Banneker returned to his book. A freight,
      &ldquo;running extra,&rdquo; interrupted him, but not for long. The wire
      had been practicing a seemly restraint for uneventful weeks, so the agent
      felt that he could settle down to a sure hour&rsquo;s bookishness yet,
      even though the west-bound Transcontinental Special should be on time,
      which was improbable, as &ldquo;bad track&rdquo; had been reported from
      eastward, owing to the rains. Rather to his surprise, he had hardly got
      well reimmersed in the enchantments of the mercantile fairyland when the
      &ldquo;Open Office&rdquo; wire warned him to be attentive, and presently
      from the east came tidings of Number Three running almost true to
      schedule, as befitted the pride of the line, the finest train that crossed
      the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past the gaunt station she roared, only seven minutes late, giving the
      imaginative young official a glimpse and flash of the uttermost luxury of
      travel: rich woods, gleaming metal, elegance of finish, and on the rear of
      the observation-car a group so lily-clad that Sears-Roebuck at its most
      glorious was not like unto them. Would such a train, the implanted youth
      wondered, ever bear him away to unknown, undreamed enchantments?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he even wish to go if he might? Life was full of many things to do
      and learn at Manzanita. Mahomet need not go to the mountain when, with but
      a mustard seed of faith in the proven potency of mail-order miracles he
      could move mountains to come to him. Leaning to his telegraph instrument,
      he wired to the agent at Stanwood, twenty-six miles down-line, his formal
      announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O. S.&mdash;G. I. No. 3 by at 10.46.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O. K.&mdash;D. S.,&rdquo; came the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker returned to the sunlight. In seven minutes or perhaps less, as
      the Transcontinental would be straining to make up lost time, the train
      would enter Rock Cut three miles and more west, and he would recapture the
      powerful throbbing of the locomotive as she emerged on the farther side,
      having conquered the worst of the grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker waited. He drew out his watch. Seven. Seven and a half. Eight. No
      sound from westward. He frowned. Like most of the road&rsquo;s employees,
      he took a special and almost personal interest in having the regal train
      on time, as if, in dispatching it through, he had given it a friendly push
      on its swift and mighty mission. Was she steaming badly? There had been no
      sign of it as she passed. Perhaps something had gone wrong with the
      brakes. Or could the track have&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent tilted sharply forward, his lithe frame tense. A long drawn,
      quivering shriek came down-wind to him. It was repeated. Then short and
      sharp, piercing note on piercing note, sounded the shrill, clamant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great engine of Number Three was yelling for help.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Banneker came out of his chair with a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!&rdquo; screamed the strident voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like an animal in pain and panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief instant the station-agent halted at the door to assure himself
      that the call was stationary. It was. Also it was slightly muffled. That
      meant that the train was still in the cut. As he ran to the key and sent
      in the signal for Stanwood, Banneker reflected what this might mean.
      Crippled? Likely enough. Ditched? He guessed not. A ditched locomotive is
      usually voiceless if not driverless as well. Blocked by a slide? Rock Cut
      had a bad repute for that kind of accident. But the quality of the call
      predicated more of a catastrophe than a mere blockade. Besides, in that
      case why could not the train back down&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answering signal from the dispatcher at Stanwood interrupted his
      conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number Three in trouble in the Cut,&rdquo; ticked Banneker
      fluently. &ldquo;Think help probably needed from you. Shall I go out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;Take charge. Bad track
      reported three miles east may delay arrival.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker dropped and locked the windows, set his signal for &ldquo;track
      blocked&rdquo; and ran to the portable house. Inside he stood,
      considering. With swift precision he took from one of the home-carpentered
      shelves a compact emergency kit, 17 S 4230, &ldquo;hefted&rdquo; it, and
      adjusted it, knapsack fashion, to his back; then from a small cabinet drew
      a flask, which he disposed in his hip-pocket. Another part of the same
      cabinet provided a first-aid outfit, 3 R 0114. Thus equipped he was just
      closing the door after him when another thought struck him and he returned
      to slip a coil of light, strong sash-cord, 36 J 9078, over his shoulders
      to his waist where he deftly tautened it. He had seen railroad wrecks
      before. For a moment he considered leaving his coat, for he had upwards of
      three miles to go in the increasing heat; but, reflecting that the outward
      and visible signs of authority might save time and questions, he thought
      better of it. Patting his pocket to make sure that his necessary notebook
      and pencil were there, he set out at a moderate, even, springless lope. He
      had no mind to reach a scene which might require his best qualities of
      mind and body, in a semi-exhausted state. Nevertheless, laden as he was,
      he made the three miles in less than half an hour. Let no man who has not
      tried to cover at speed the ribbed treacheries of a railroad track
      minimize the achievement!
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp curve leads to the entrance of Rock Cut. Running easily, Banneker
      had reached the beginning of the turn, when he became aware of a lumbering
      figure approaching him at a high and wild sort of half-gallop. The man&rsquo;s
      face was a welter of blood. One hand was pressed to it. The other swung
      crazily as he ran. He would have swept past Banneker unregarding had not
      the agent caught him by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner stared wildly at the young man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soom,&rdquo;
      he mumbled breathlessly, his hand still crumpled against the dreadfully
      smeared face. &ldquo;Dammum, I&rsquo;ll soom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He removed his hand from his mouth, and the red drops splattered and were
      lost upon the glittering, thirsty sand. Banneker wiped the man&rsquo;s
      face, and found no injury. But the fingers which he had crammed into his
      mouth were bleeding profusely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They oughta be prosecuted,&rdquo; moaned the sufferer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      soom. For ten thousan&rsquo; dollars. M&rsquo;hand is smashed. Looka that!
      Smashed like a bug.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker caught the hand and expertly bound it, taking the man&rsquo;s
      name and address as he worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a bad wreck?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell. Look at m&rsquo;hand! But I&rsquo;ll soom, all
      right. <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll show&rsquo;m ... Oh! ... Cars are afire, too ...
      Oh-h-h! Where&rsquo;s a hospital?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cursed weakly as Banneker, without answering, re-stowed his packet and
      ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin wisp of smoke rising above the nearer wall of rocks made the agent
      set his teeth. Throughout his course the voice of the engine had, as it
      were, yapped at his hurrying heels, but now it was silent, and he could
      hear a murmur of voices and an occasional shouted order. He came into
      sight of the accident, to face a bewildering scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred yards up the track stood the major portion of the train,
      intact. Behind it, by itself, lay a Pullman sleeper, on its side and
      apparently little harmed. Nearest to Banneker, partly on the rails but
      mainly beside them, was jumbled a ridiculous mess of woodwork, with here
      and there a gleam of metal, centering on a large and jagged boulder.
      Smaller rocks were scattered through the <i>mélange</i>. It was exactly
      like a heap of giant jack-straws into which some mischievous spirit had
      tossed a large pebble. At one end a flame sputtered and spread cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      A panting and grimy conductor staggered toward it with a pail of water
      from the engine. Banneker accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one in&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get outa my way!&rdquo; gasped the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agent at Manzanita.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor set down his pail. &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did
      you bring any help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m alone. Any one in there?&rdquo; He pointed to the
      flaming debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that we know of. He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; cried Banneker sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for yourself. Go the other side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker looked and returned, white and set of face. &ldquo;How many
      others?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven, so far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the agent with a sense of relief. It
      seemed as if no occupant could have come forth of that ghastly and absurd
      rubbish-heap, which had been two luxurious Pullmans, alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dozen that&rsquo;s hurt bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use watering that mess,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
      burn much further. Wind&rsquo;s against it. Anybody left in the other
      smashed cars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the names of the dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how would I have the time!&rdquo; demanded the conductor
      resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker turned to the far side of the track where the seven bodies lay.
      They were not disposed decorously. The faces were uncovered. The postures
      were crumpled and grotesque. A forgotten corner of a battle-field might
      look like that, the young agent thought, bloody and disordered and casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearest him was the body of a woman badly crushed, and, crouching beside
      it, a man who fondled one of its hands, weeping quietly. Close by lay the
      corpse of a child showing no wound or mark, and next that, something so
      mangled that it might have been either man or woman&mdash;or neither. The
      other victims were humped or sprawled upon the sand in postures of
      exaggerated <i>abandon</i>; all but one, a blonde young girl whose
      upthrust arm seemed to be reaching for something just beyond her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of the uninjured from the forward cars surrounded and enclosed a
      confused sound of moaning and crying. Banneker pushed briskly through the
      ring. About twenty wounded lay upon the ground or were propped against the
      rock-wall. Over them two women were expertly working, one tiny and
      beautiful, with jewels gleaming on her reddened hands; the other brisk,
      homely, with a suggestion of the professional in her precise motions. A
      broad, fat, white-bearded man seemed to be informally in charge. At least
      he was giving directions in a growling voice as he bent over the
      sufferers. Banneker went to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not even look up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; he
      snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station-agent pushed his first-aid packet into the old man&rsquo;s
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; grunted the other. &ldquo;Hold this fellow&rsquo;s
      head, will you? Hold it hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s wrists were props of steel as he gripped the tossing
      head. The old man took a turn with a bandage and fastened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll die, anyway,&rdquo; he said, and lifted his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker cackled like a silly girl at full sight of him. The spreading
      whisker on the far side of his stern face was gayly pied in blotches of
      red and green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to have hysterics?&rdquo; demanded the old man, striking not
      so far short of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the agent, mastering himself. &ldquo;Hey! you,
      trainman,&rdquo; he called to a hobbling, blue-coated fellow. &ldquo;Bring
      two buckets of water from the boiler-tap, hot and clean. Clean, mind you!&rdquo;
      The man nodded and limped away. &ldquo;Anything else, Doctor?&rdquo; asked
      the agent. &ldquo;Got towels?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m not a doctor&mdash;not for forty years. But I&rsquo;m
      the nearest thing to it in this shambles. Who are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in five minutes,&rdquo; he
      said and passed into the subdued and tremulous crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the outskirts loitered a lank, idle young man clad beyond the glories
      of Messrs. Sears-Roebuck&rsquo;s highest-colored imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you run three miles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take an urgent message to be wired from Manzanita?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the youth with good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tearing a leaf from his pocket-ledger, Banneker scribbled a dispatch which
      is still preserved in the road&rsquo;s archives as giving more vital
      information in fewer words than any other railroad document extant. He
      instructed the messenger where to find a substitute telegrapher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer?&rdquo; asked the youth, unfurling his long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Banneker, and the courier, tossing his coat
      off, took the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker turned back to the improvised hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to move these people into the cars,&rdquo; he said
      to the man in charge. &ldquo;The berths are being made up now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. Banneker gathered helpers and superintended the
      transfer. One of the passengers, an elderly lady who had shown no sign of
      grave injury, died smiling courageously as they were lifting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave Banneker a momentary shock of helpless responsibility. Why should
      she have been the one to die? Only five minutes before she had spoken to
      him in self-possessed, even tones, saying that her traveling-bag contained
      camphor, ammonia, and iodine if he needed them. She had seemed a reliable,
      helpful kind of lady, and now she was dead. It struck Banneker as
      improbable and, in a queer sense, discriminatory. Remembering the slight,
      ready smile with which she had addressed him, he felt as if he had
      suffered a personal loss; he would have liked to stay and work over her,
      trying to discover if there might not be some spark of life remaining, to
      be cherished back into flame, but the burly old man&rsquo;s decisive
      &ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; settled that. Besides, there were other things,
      official things to be looked to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full report would be expected of him, as to the cause of the accident.
      The presence of the boulder in the wreckage explained that grimly. It was
      now his routine duty to collect the names of the dead and wounded, and
      such details as he could elicit. He went about it briskly,
      conscientiously, and with distaste. All this would go to the claim agent
      of the road eventually and might serve to mitigate the total of damages
      exacted of the company. Vaguely Banneker resented such probable penalties
      as unfair; the most unremitting watchfulness could not have detected the
      subtle undermining of that fatal boulder. But essentially he was not
      interested in claims and damages. His sensitive mind hovered around the
      mystery of death; that file of crumpled bodies, the woman of the stilled
      smile, the man fondling a limp hand, weeping quietly. Officially, he was a
      smooth-working bit of mechanism. As an individual he probed tragic depths
      to which he was alien otherwise than by a large and vague sympathy. Facts
      of the baldest were entered neatly; but in the back of his eager brain
      Banneker was storing details of a far different kind and of no earthly use
      to a railroad corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became aware of some one waiting at his elbow. The lank young man had
      spoken to him twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Banneker sharply. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you! How
      did you get back so soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the hour,&rdquo; replied the other with pride. &ldquo;Your
      message has gone. The operator&rsquo;s a queer duck. Dealing faro. Made me
      play through a case before he&rsquo;d quit. I stung him for twenty. Here&rsquo;s
      some stuff I thought might be useful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From a cotton bag he discharged a miscellaneous heap of patent
      preparations; salves, ointments, emollients, liniments, plasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I could get,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;No drug-store in the
      funny burg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right.
      Want another job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the lily of the field with undiminished
      good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and help the white-whiskered old boy in the Pullman yonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;d chase me,&rdquo; returned the other calmly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      my uncle. He thinks I&rsquo;m no use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he? Well, suppose you get names and addresses of the slightly
      injured for me, then. Here&rsquo;s your coat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha-anks,&rdquo; drawled the young man. He was turning away to his
      new duties when a thought struck him. &ldquo;Making a list?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. For my report.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a name with the initials I. O. W.?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker ran through the roster in the pocket-ledger. &ldquo;Not yet. Some
      one that&rsquo;s hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what became of her. Peach of a girl. Black hair,
      big, sleepy, black eyes with a fire in &rsquo;em. Dressed <i>right</i>.
      Traveling alone, and minding her own business, too. Had a stateroom in
      that Pullman there in the ditch. Noticed her initials on her
      traveling-bag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her since the smash?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Got a kind of confused recklection of seeing her
      wobbling around at the side of the track. Can&rsquo;t be sure, though.
      Might have been me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might have been you? How could&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wobbly, myself. Mixed in my thinks. When I came to I was pretty
      busy putting my lunch,&rdquo; explained the other with simple realism.
      &ldquo;One of Mr. Pullman&rsquo;s seats butted me in the stomach. They ain&rsquo;t
      upholstered as soft as you&rsquo;d think to look at &rsquo;em. I went
      reeling around, looking for Miss I. O. W., she being alone, you know, and
      I thought she might need some looking after. And I had that idea of having
      seen her with her hand to her head dazed and running&mdash;yes; that&rsquo;s
      it, she was running. Wow!&rdquo; said the young man fervently. &ldquo;She
      was a pretty thing! You don&rsquo;t suppose&mdash;&rdquo; He turned
      hesitantly to the file of bodies, now decently covered with sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a grisly instant Banneker thought of the one mangled monstrosity&mdash;<i>that</i>
      to have been so lately loveliness and charm, with deep fire in its eyes
      and perhaps deep tenderness and passion in its heart. He dismissed the
      thought as being against the evidence and entered the initials in his
      booklet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for her,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Probably she&rsquo;s
      forward somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without respite he toiled until a long whistle gave notice of the return
      of the locomotive which had gone forward to meet the delayed special from
      Stanwood. Human beings were clinging about it in little clusters like
      bees; physicians, nurses, officials, and hospital attendants. The
      dispatcher from Stanwood listened to Banneker&rsquo;s brief report, and
      sent him back to Manzanita, with a curt word of approval for his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s last sight of the wreck, as he paused at the curve, was
      the helpful young man perched on the rear heap of wreckage which had been
      the observation car, peering anxiously into its depths (&ldquo;Looking for
      I. O. W. probably,&rdquo; surmised the agent), and two commercial
      gentlemen from the smoker whiling away a commercially unproductive hiatus
      by playing pinochle on a suitcase held across their knees. Glancing at the
      vast, swollen, blue-black billows rolling up the sky, Banneker guessed
      that their game would be shortly interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped that the dead would not get wet.
    </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Back in his office, Banneker sent out the necessary wires, and learned
      from westward that it might be twelve hours before the break in the track
      near Stanwood could be fixed up. Then he settled down to his report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his earlier telegram, the report was a little masterpiece of concise
      information. Not a word in it that was not dry, exact, meaningful. This
      was the more to the writer&rsquo;s credit in that his brain was seething
      with impressions, luminous with pictures, aflash with odds and ends of
      minor but significant things heard and seen and felt. It was his first
      inner view of tragedy and of the reactions of the human creature, brave or
      stupid or merely absurd, to a crisis. For all of this he had an outlet of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking from the wall a file marked &ldquo;Letters. Private"-it was 5 S
      0027, and one of his most used purchases&mdash;he extracted some sheets of
      a special paper and, sitting at his desk, wrote and wrote and wrote,
      absorbedly, painstakingly, happily. Wind swept the outer world into a
      vortex of wild rain; the room boomed and trembled with the reverberations
      of thunder. Twice the telegraph instrument broke in on him; but these
      matters claimed only the outer shell; the soul of the man was concerned
      with committing its impressions of other souls to the secrecy of white
      paper, destined to personal and inviolable archives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one entered the waiting-room. There was a tap on his door. Raising
      his head impatiently, Banneker saw, through the window already dimming
      with the gathering dusk, a large roan horse, droopy and disconsolate in
      the downpour. He jumped up and threw open his retreat. A tall woman,
      slipping out of a streaming poncho, entered. The simplicity, verging upon
      coarseness, of her dress detracted nothing from her distinction of
      bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there trouble on the line?&rdquo; she asked in a voice of
      peculiar clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad trouble, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; answered Banneker. He pushed
      forward a chair, but she shook her head. &ldquo;A loosened rock smashed
      into Number Three in the Cut. Eight dead, and a lot more in bad shape.
      They&rsquo;ve got doctors and nurses from Stanwood. But the track&rsquo;s
      out below. And from what I get on the wire&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded toward
      the east&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be out above before long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go up there,&rdquo; said she. Her lips grew
      bloodless as she spoke and there was a look of effort and pain in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t think so. But if you&rsquo;ll go over to the town
      and see that Torrey gets his place cleaned up a bit, I suppose some of the
      passengers will be coming in pretty soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a quick gesture of repulsion. &ldquo;Women can&rsquo;t go to
      Torrey&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too filthy. Besides&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      take in the women, if there aren&rsquo;t too many and I can pick up a
      buckboard in Manzanita.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be better, if any come in. Give me their
      names, won&rsquo;t you? I have to keep track of them, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner of the two was that of familiars, of friends, though there was
      a touch of deference in Banneker&rsquo;s bearing, too subtly personal to
      be attributed to his official status. He went out to adjust the visitor&rsquo;s
      poncho, and, swinging her leg across the Mexican saddle of her horse with
      the mechanical ease of one habituated to this mode of travel, she was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the agent returned to his unofficial task and was instantly
      submerged in it. Impatiently he interrupted himself to light the lamps and
      at once resumed his pen. An emphatic knock at his door only caused him to
      shake his head. The summons was repeated. With a sigh Banneker gathered
      the written sheets, enclosed them in 5 S 0027, and restored that
      receptacle to its place. Meantime the knocking continued impatiently,
      presently pointed by a deep&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one inside there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Banneker, opening to face the bulky old man who
      had cared for the wounded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uninvited, and with an assured air, the visitor stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Horace Vanney,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know my name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In no wise discountenanced by the matter-of-fact negative, Mr. Vanney,
      still unsolicited, took a chair. &ldquo;You would if you read the
      newspapers,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The New York papers,&rdquo; pursued the other, benignly
      explanatory. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I came in to say that I shall
      make it my business to report your energy and efficiency to your
      superiors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Banneker politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can assure you that my commendation will carry weight.
      Weight, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent accepted this with a nod, obviously unimpressed. In fact, Mr.
      Vanney suspected with annoyance, he was listening not so much to these
      encouraging statements as to some unidentified noise outside. The agent
      raised the window and addressed some one who had approached through the
      steady drive of the rain. A gauntleted hand thrust through the window a
      slip of paper which he took. As he moved, a ray of light from the lamp,
      unblocked by his shoulder, fell upon the face of the person in the
      darkness, illuminating it to the astounded eyes of Mr. Horace Vanney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of them are going home with me,&rdquo; said a voice. &ldquo;Will
      you send these wires to the addresses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Banneker, &ldquo;and thank you.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; barked Mr. Vanney, half rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would swear to that face.&rdquo; He seemed quite excited. &ldquo;I
      would swear to it anywhere. It is unforgettable. That was Camilla Van
      Arsdale. Was she in the wreck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that it wasn&rsquo;t she! Don&rsquo;t try to
      tell me, for I won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to tell you anything,&rdquo; Banneker pointed
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re close-mouthed enough. But&mdash;Camilla
      Van Arsdale! Incredible! Does she live here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here or hereabouts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give me the address. I must surely go and see her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a friend of Miss Van Arsdale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hardly say so much. A friend of her family, rather. She
      would remember me, I am sure. And, in any case, she would know my name.
      Where did you say she lived?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mystery-making!&rdquo; The big man&rsquo;s gruffness had a
      suggestion of amusement in it. &ldquo;But of course it would be simple
      enough to find out from town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Mr. Vanney, Miss Van Arsdale is still something of an
      invalid&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all these years,&rdquo; interposed the other, in the tone of
      one who ruminates upon a marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I happen to know that it isn&rsquo;t well for&mdash;that
      is, she doesn&rsquo;t care to see strangers, particularly from New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared. &ldquo;Are you a gentleman?&rdquo; he asked with
      abrupt surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman?&rdquo; repeated Banneker, taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the visitor earnestly. &ldquo;I
      meant no offense. You are doubtless quite right. As for any intrusion, I
      assure you there will be none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker nodded, and with that nod dismissed the subject quite as
      effectually as Mr. Horace Vanney himself could have done. &ldquo;Did you
      attend all the injured?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the serious ones, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a young girl among them, dark and good-looking, whose
      name began&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one my addle-brained young nephew has been pestering me about?
      Miss I. O. W.?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He reported her to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I handled no such case that I recall. Now, as to your own
      helpfulness, I wish to make clear that I appreciate it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vanney launched into a flowery tribute of the after-dinner variety,
      leaning forward to rest a hand upon Banneker&rsquo;s desk as he spoke.
      When the speech was over and the hand withdrawn, something remained among
      the strewn papers. Banneker regarded it with interest. It showed a blotch
      of yellow upon green and a capital C. Picking it up, he looked from it to
      its giver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little tribute,&rdquo; said that gentleman: &ldquo;a slight
      recognition of your services.&rdquo; His manner suggested that
      hundred-dollar bills were inconsiderable trifles, hardly requiring the
      acknowledgment of thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case the bill did not secure such acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me anything,&rdquo; stated the agent. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t take this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Pride? Tut-tut.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding no immediate and appropriate answer to this simple question, Mr.
      Vanney stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The company pays me. There&rsquo;s no reason why you should pay me.
      If anything, I ought to pay you for what you did at the wreck. But I&rsquo;m
      not proposing to. Of course I&rsquo;m putting in my report a statement
      about your help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vanney&rsquo;s cheek flushed. Was this composed young hireling making
      sport of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut-tut!&rdquo; he said again, this time with obvious intent to
      chide in his manner. &ldquo;If I see fit to signify my appreciation&mdash;remember,
      I am old enough to be your father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to have better judgment,&rdquo; returned Banneker
      with such candor and good-humor that the visitor was fairly discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      An embarrassing silence&mdash;embarrassing, that is, to the older man; the
      younger seemed not to feel it&mdash;was happily interrupted by the advent
      of the lily-clad messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily retrieving his yellow-back, which he subjected to some furtive and
      occult manipulations, Mr. Vanney, after a few words, took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker invited the newcomer to take the chair thus vacated. As he did so
      he brushed something to the floor and picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s this? Looks like a hundred-bucker. Yours?&rdquo;
      He held out the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head. &ldquo;Your uncle left it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a habit of his,&rdquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him for me, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Any message?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer grinned. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
      bored when he gets this back. He isn&rsquo;t a bad old bird, but he don&rsquo;t
      savvy some things. So you turned him down, did you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he offer you a job and a chance to make your way in the world
      in one of his banks, beginning at ten-per?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other gave a thought to the bill. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right.
      He likes em meek and obedient. He&rsquo;d make a woolly lamb out of you.
      Most fellows would jump at the chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Herbert Cressey.&rdquo; He handed the agent a card.
      &ldquo;Philadelphia is my home, but my New York address is on there, too.
      Ever get East?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Chicago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chicago?&rdquo; The other stared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to
      do with&mdash;Oh, I see. You&rsquo;ll be coming to New York one of these
      days, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure as a gun. A chap that can handle a situation like you handled
      the wreck isn&rsquo;t going to stick in a little sand-heap like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suits me here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Does it? I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d die of it. Well, when you
      do get East look me up, will you? I mean it; I&rsquo;d like to see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s anything I can do for you any time, drop me a
      line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sumptuous ripple and gleam of the young man&rsquo;s faultless coat,
      registered upon Banneker&rsquo;s subconscious memory as it had fallen at
      his feet, recalled itself to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What store do you buy your clothes at?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Store?&rdquo; Cressey did not smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t buy
      &rsquo;em at a store. I have &rsquo;em made by a tailor. Mertoun, 505
      Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he make me a suit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. I&rsquo;ll give you a card to him and you go in there
      when you&rsquo;re in New York and pick out what you want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! He wouldn&rsquo;t make them and send them out here to me?
      Sears-Roebuck do, if you send your measure. They&rsquo;re in Chicago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had any duds built in Chicago, so I don&rsquo;t know them.
      But I shouldn&rsquo;t think Mertoun would want to fit a man he&rsquo;d
      never seen. They like to do things <i>right</i>, at Mertoun&rsquo;s. Ought
      to, too; they stick you enough for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much short of a hundred for a sack suit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was amazed. The choicest &ldquo;made-to-measure&rdquo; in his
      Universal Guide, &ldquo;Snappy, fashionable, and up to the minute,&rdquo;
      came to less than half of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      His admiring eye fell upon his visitor&rsquo;s bow-tie, faultless and
      underanged throughout the vicissitudes of that arduous day, and he yearned
      to know whether it was &ldquo;made-up&rdquo; or self-confected.
      Sears-Roebuck were severely impartial as between one practice and the
      other, offering a wide range in each variety. He inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tied it myself, of course,&rdquo; returned Cressey. &ldquo;Nobody
      wears the ready-made kind. It&rsquo;s no trick to do it. I&rsquo;ll show
      you, any time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into friendly talk about the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten-thirty when Banneker finished his much-interrupted writing.
      Going out to the portable house, he lighted an oil-stove and proceeded to
      make a molasses pie. He was due for a busy day on the morrow and might not
      find time to take the mile walk to the hotel for dinner, as was his
      general habit. With the store of canned goods derived from the mail-order
      catalogue, he could always make shift to live. Besides, he was young
      enough to relish keenly molasses pie and the manufacture of it. Having
      concluded his cookery in strict accordance with the rules set forth in the
      guide to this art, he laid it out on the sill to cool over night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired though he was, his brain was too busy for immediate sleep. He
      returned to his den, drew out a book and began to read with absorption.
      That in which he now sought release and distraction was not the <i>magnum
      opus</i> of Messrs. Sears-Roebuck, but the work of a less practical and
      popular writer, being in fact the &ldquo;Eve of St. Agnes,&rdquo; by John
      Keats. Soothed and dreamy, he put out the lights, climbed to his living
      quarters above the office, and fell asleep. It was then eleven-thirty and
      his official day had terminated five hours earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock he arose and patiently descended the stairs again.
      Some one was hammering on the door. He opened without inquiry, which was
      not the part of wisdom in that country and at that hour. His pocket-flash
      gleamed on a thin young man in a black-rubber coat who, with head and
      hands retracted as far as possible from the pouring rain, resembled a
      disconsolate turtle with an insufficient carapace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gardner, of the Angelica City Herald,&rdquo; explained
      the untimely visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was surprised. That a reporter should come all the way from the
      metropolis of the Southwest to his wreck&mdash;he had already established
      proprietary interest in it&mdash;was gratifying. Furthermore, for reasons
      of his own, he was glad to see a journalist. He took him in and lighted up
      the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had to get a horse and ride to Manzanita to interview old Vanney
      and a couple of other big guys from the East. My first story&rsquo;s on
      the wire,&rdquo; explained the newcomer offhand. &ldquo;I want some
      local-color stuff for my second day follow-up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be hard to do that,&rdquo; said Banneker interestedly,
      &ldquo;when you haven&rsquo;t seen any of it yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patchwork and imagination,&rdquo; returned the other wearily.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get special rates for. Now, if I&rsquo;d had
      your chance, right there on the spot, with the whole stage-setting around
      one&mdash;Lordy! How a fellow could write that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so easy,&rdquo; murmured the agent. &ldquo;You get confused. It&rsquo;s
      a sort of blur, and when you come to put it down, little things that aren&rsquo;t
      really important come up to the surface&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it down?&rdquo; queried the other with a quick look. &ldquo;Oh,
      I see. Your report for the company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you write other things?&rdquo; asked the reporter carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just foolery.&rdquo; The tone invited&mdash;at least it did not
      discourage&mdash;further inquiry. Mr. Gardner was bored. Amateurs who
      &ldquo;occasionally write&rdquo; were the bane of him who, having a
      signature of his own in the leading local paper, represented to the
      aspiring mind the gilded and lofty peaks of the unattainable. However he
      must play this youth as a source of material.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever try for the papers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;ve thought maybe I might get a chance sometime as
      a sort of local correspondent around here,&rdquo; was the diffident reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner repressed a grin. Manzanita would hardly qualify as a news center.
      Diplomacy prompted him to state vaguely that there was always a chance for
      good stuff locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a big story like this,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;of course there&rsquo;d
      be nothing doing except for the special man sent out to cover it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Well, I didn&rsquo;t write my&mdash;what I wrote, with any idea
      of getting it printed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper man sighed wearily, sighed like a child and lied like a man
      of duty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a trace of hesitation or self-consciousness Banneker said, &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; and, taking his composition from its docket, motioned the
      other to the light. Mr. Gardner finished and turned the first sheet before
      making any observation. Then he bent a queer look upon Banneker and
      grunted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call this stuff, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just putting down what I saw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner read on. &ldquo;What about this, about a Pullman sleeper &lsquo;elegant
      as a hotel bar and rigid as a church pew&rsquo;? Where do you get that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker looked startled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It just struck me
      that is the way a Pullman is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is,&rdquo; admitted the visitor, and continued to read.
      &ldquo;And this guy with the smashed finger that kept threatening to
      &lsquo;soom&rsquo;; is that right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s right. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d make it
      up! That reminds me of something.&rdquo; And he entered a memo to see the
      litigious-minded complainant again, for these are the cases which often
      turn up in the courts with claims for fifty-thousand-dollar damages and
      heartrending details of all-but-mortal internal injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence held the reader until he had concluded the seventh and last sheet.
      Not looking at Banneker, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your notion of reporting the wreck of the swellest
      train that crosses the continent, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be a report,&rdquo; disclaimed the
      writer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty bad, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten!&rdquo; Gardner paused. &ldquo;From a news-desk
      point of view. Any copy-reader would chuck it. Unless I happened to sign
      it,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;d cuss it out and let it pass,
      and the dear old pin-head public would eat it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s of any use to you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, my boy, not so! I might pinch your wad if you left it
      around loose, or even your last cigarette, but not your stuff. Let me take
      it along, though; it may give me some ideas. I&rsquo;ll return it. Now,
      where can I get a bed in the town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere. Everything&rsquo;s filled. But I can give you a hammock
      out in my shack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. I&rsquo;ll take it. Thanks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker kept his guest awake beyond the limits of decent hospitality,
      asking him questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, constantly more interested in this unexpected find of a real
      personality in an out-of-the-way minor station of the high desert,
      meditated a character study of &ldquo;the hero of the wreck,&rdquo; but
      could not quite contrive any peg whereon to hang the wreath of heroism. By
      his own modest account, Banneker had been competent but wholly
      unpicturesque, though the characters in his sketch, rude and unformed
      though it was, stood out clearly. As to his own personal history, the
      agent was unresponsive. At length the guest, apologizing for untimely
      weariness, it being then 3.15 A.M., yawned his way to the portable shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept heavily, except for a brief period when the rain let up. In the
      morning&mdash;which term seasoned newspaper men apply to twelve noon and
      the hour or two thereafter&mdash;he inquired of Banneker, &ldquo;Any
      tramps around here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the agent, &ldquo;Not often. There were a pair
      yesterday morning, but they went on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one was fussing around the place about first light. I was too
      sleepy to get up. I yipped and they beat it. I don&rsquo;t think they got
      inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker investigated. Nothing was missing from within the shack. But
      outside he made a distressing discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      His molasses pie was gone.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To accomplish a dessert as simple and inexpensive as it is tasty,&rdquo;
      prescribes The Complete Manual of Cookery, p. 48, &ldquo;take one cup of
      thick molasses&mdash;&rdquo; But why should I infringe a copyright when
      the culinary reader may acquire the whole range of kitchen lore by
      expending eighty-nine cents plus postage on 39 T 337? Banneker had
      faithfully followed the prescribed instructions. The result had certainly
      been simple and inexpensive; presumably it would have proven tasty. He
      regretted and resented the rape of the pie. What aroused greater concern,
      however, was the presence of thieves. In the soft ground near the window
      he found some rather small footprints which suggested that it was the
      younger of the two hoboes who had committed the depredation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theorizing, however, was not the order of his day. Routine and
      extra-routine claimed all his time. There was his supplementary report to
      make out; the marooned travelers in Manzanita to be looked after and their
      bitter complaints to be listened to; consultations over the wire as to the
      condition and probabilities of the roadbed, for the floods had come again;
      and in and out of it all, the busy, weary, indefatigable Gardner, giving
      to the agent as much information as he asked from him. When their final
      lists were compared, Banneker noticed that there was no name with the
      initials I.O.W. on Gardner&rsquo;s. He thought of mentioning the clue, but
      decided that it was of too little definiteness and importance. The news
      value of mystery, enhanced by youth and beauty, which the veriest cub who
      had ever smelled printer&rsquo;s ink would have appreciated, was a sealed
      book to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until late that afternoon did a rescue train limp cautiously along an
      improvised track to set the interrupted travelers on their way. Gardner
      went on it, leaving an address and an invitation to &ldquo;keep in touch.&rdquo;
      Mr. Vanney took his departure with a few benign and well-chosen words of
      farewell, accompanied by the assurance that he would &ldquo;make it his
      special purpose to commend,&rdquo; and so on. His nephew, Herbert Cressey,
      the lily-clad messenger, stopped at the station to shake hands and grin
      rather vacantly, and adjure Banneker, whom he addressed as &ldquo;old
      chap,&rdquo; to be sure and look him up in the East; he&rsquo;d be glad to
      see him any time. Banneker believed that he meant it. He promised to do
      so, though without particular interest. With the others departed Miss
      Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s two emergency guests, one of them the rather
      splendid young woman who had helped with the wounded. They invaded
      Banneker&rsquo;s office with supplementary telegrams and talked about
      their hostess with that freedom which women of the world use before dogs
      or uniformed officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a woman!&rdquo; said the amateur nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a house!&rdquo; supplemented the other, a faded and lined
      middle-aged wife who had just sent a reassuring and very long wire to a
      husband in Pittsburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much the châtelaine; grande dame and that sort of thing,&rdquo;
      pursued the other. &ldquo;One might almost think her English.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The other shook her head positively. &ldquo;Old
      American. As old and as good as her name. You wouldn&rsquo;t flatter her
      by guessing her to be anything else. I dare say she would consider the
      average British aristocrat a little shoddy and loud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are when they come over here. But what on earth is her type
      doing out here, buried with a one-eyed, half-breed manservant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a concert grand piano. Don&rsquo;t forget that. She tunes it
      herself, too. Did you notice the tools? A possible romance. You&rsquo;ve
      quite a nose for such things, Sue. Couldn&rsquo;t you get anything out of
      her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much too good a nose to put in the crack of a door,&rdquo;
      retorted the pretty woman. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to lay myself
      open to being snubbed by her. It might be painful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It probably would.&rdquo; The Pittsburgher turned to Banneker with
      a change of tone, implying that he could not have taken any possible heed
      of what went before. &ldquo;Has Miss Van Arsdale lived here long, do you
      know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent looked at her intently for a moment before replying: &ldquo;Longer
      than I have.&rdquo; He transferred his gaze to the pretty woman. &ldquo;You
      two were her guests, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors glanced at each other, half amused, half aghast. The tone and
      implication of the question had been too significant to be misunderstood.
      &ldquo;Well, of all extraordinary&mdash;&rdquo; began one of them under
      her breath; and the other said more loudly, &ldquo;I really beg&mdash;&rdquo;
      and then she, too, broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out. &ldquo;Châtelaine and knightly defender,&rdquo; commented
      the younger one in the refuge of the outer office. &ldquo;Have we been
      dumped off a train into the midst of the Middle Ages? Where do you get
      station-agents like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one at our suburban station chews tobacco and says &lsquo;Marm&rsquo;
      through his nose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker emerged, seeking the conductor of the special with a message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rather a beautiful young thing, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning, he helped them on the train with their hand-luggage. When the
      bustle and confusion of dispatching an extra were over, he sat down to
      think. But not of Miss Camilla Van Arsdale. That was an old story, though
      its chapters were few, and none of them as potentially eventful as this
      intrusion of Vanneys and female chatterers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the molasses pie that stuck in his mind. There was no time to make
      another. Further, the thought of depredators hanging about disturbed him.
      That shack of his was full of Aladdin treasures, delivered by the summoned
      genii of the Great Book. Though it was secured by Little Guardian locks
      and fortified with the Scarem Buzz alarm, he did not feel sure of it. He
      decided to sleep there that night with his .45-caliber Sure-shot revolver.
      Let them come again; he&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em a lesson! On second
      thought, he rebaited the window-ledge with a can of Special Juicy Apricot
      Preserve. At ten o&rsquo;clock he turned in, determined to sleep lightly,
      and immediately plunged into fathomless depths of unconsciousness, lulled
      by a singing wind and the drone of the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light, flashing across his eyes, awakened him. For a moment he lay,
      dazed, confused by the gentle and unfamiliar oscillations of his hammock.
      Another flicker of light and a rumble of thunder brought him to his full
      senses. The rain had degenerated into a casual drizzle and the wind had
      withdrawn into the higher areas. He heard some one moving outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly he reached out to the stand at his elbow, got his revolver
      and his flashlight, and slipped to the floor. The malefactor without was
      approaching the window. Another flash of lightning would have revealed
      much to Banneker had he not been crouching close under the sill, on the
      inside, so that the radiance of his light, when he found the button,
      should not expose him to a straight shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand fumbled at the open window. Finger on trigger, Banneker held up his
      flashlight in his left hand and irradiated the spot. He saw the hand,
      groping, and on one of its fingers something which returned a more
      brilliant gleam than the electric ray. In his crass amazement, the agent
      straightened up, a full mark for murder, staring at a diamond-and-ruby
      ring set upon a short, delicate finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound came from outside. But the hand became instantly tense. It fell
      upon the sill and clutched it so hard that the knuckles stood out, white,
      strained and garish. Banneker&rsquo;s own strong hand descended upon the
      wrist. A voice said softly and tremulously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal went straight to Banneker&rsquo;s heart and quivered there,
      like a soft flame, like music heard in an unrealizable dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked, and the voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; returned Banneker stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one did,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he demanded fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me go?&rdquo; pleaded the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shock of his discovery he had released the flash-lever so that this
      colloquy passed in darkness. Now he pressed it. A girlish figure was
      revealed, one protective arm thrown across the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike me,&rdquo; said the girl again, and again
      Banneker&rsquo;s heart was shaken within him by such tremors as the crisis
      of some deadly fear might cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been afraid before,&rdquo; she said, hanging her
      weight away from him. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His grip relaxed slightly, then tightened again. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the appealing voice mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspiration came to Banneker. &ldquo;Are you afraid of me?&rdquo; he
      asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of every thing. Of the night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed the flash into her hand, turning the light upon himself.
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that she could not fail to read in his face the profound
      and ardent wish to help her; to comfort and assure an uneasy and
      frightened spirit wandering in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a little, soft sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; said
      the voice. &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered soothingly as if to a child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      the station-agent here. You must come in out of the wet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed an overcoat on over his pajamas, ran to the door and swung it
      open. The tiny ray of light advanced, hesitated, advanced again. She
      walked into the shack, and immediately the rain burst again upon the outer
      world. Banneker&rsquo;s fleeting impression was of a vivid but dimmed
      beauty. He pushed forward a chair, found a blanket for her feet, lighted
      the &ldquo;Quick-heater&rdquo; oil-stove on which he did his cooking. She
      followed him with her eyes, deeply glowing but vague and troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a station,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s my shack. Are you cold?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very.&rdquo; She shivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that some one hurt you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They struck me. It made my head feel queer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A murderous fury surged into his brain. His hand twitched toward his
      revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hoboes,&rdquo; he whispered under his breath. &ldquo;But they
      didn&rsquo;t rob you,&rdquo; he said aloud, looking at the jeweled hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think so. I ran away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enlightenment burst upon him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began. Then, &ldquo;Tell me all you can about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything. I was in my stateroom in the car.
      The door was open. Some one must have come in and struck me. Here.&rdquo;
      She put her left hand tenderly to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, leaning over her, only half suppressed a cry. Back of the temple
      rose a great, puffed, leaden-blue wale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he busied himself heating water, getting out clean bandages and
      gauze, she leaned back with half-closed eyes in which there was neither
      fear nor wonder nor curiosity: only a still content. Banneker washed the
      wound very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head feels queer. Inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the hair ought to be cut away around the place. Right here.
      It&rsquo;s quite raw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was glorious hair. Not black, as Cressey had described it in his hasty
      sketch of the unknown I.O.W.; too alive with gleams and glints of luster
      for that. Nor were her eyes black, but rather of a deep-hued, clouded
      hazel, showing troubled shadows between their dark-lashed, heavy lids. Yet
      Banneker made no doubt but that this was the missing girl of Cressey&rsquo;s
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut my hair?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little, in one place. I think I can do it so that it won&rsquo;t
      show. There&rsquo;s so much of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she answered, yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deft. She sat quiet and soothed under his ministerings. Completed,
      the bandage looked not too unworkmanlike, and was cool and comforting to
      the hot throb of the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our doctor went back on the train, worse luck!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any other doctor,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      rather have you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a doctor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she acquiesced. &ldquo;Who are you? Did you tell me? You
      are one of the passengers, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the station-agent at Manzanita.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she looked at him wonderingly. &ldquo;Are you? I don&rsquo;t
      seem to understand. My head is very queer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to. Here&rsquo;s some tea and crackers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With subtle stirrings of delight, he watched her eat the bit that he had
      prepared for her while heating the water. But he was wise enough to know
      that she must not have much while the extent of her injury was still
      undetermined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wet?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been dry since the flood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a room with a real stove in it over the station. I&rsquo;ll
      build a fire, and you must take off your wet things and go to bed and
      sleep. If you need anything you can hammer on the floor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in my office, below. I&rsquo;m on night duty
      to-night,&rdquo; said he, tactfully fabricating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You&rsquo;re awfully kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He adjusted the oil-stove, threw a warmed blanket over her feet, and
      hurried to his room to build the promised fire. When he came back she
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are good to me! It&rsquo;s stupid of me&mdash;my head is so
      queer&mdash;did you say you were&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The station-agent. My name is Banneker. I&rsquo;m responsible to
      the company for your safety and comfort. You&rsquo;re not to worry about
      it, nor think about it, nor ask any questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw the blanket around her shoulders. At the protective touch she
      slipped her hand through his arm. So they went out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the stairs, she stumbled, and for a moment he felt the firm, warm
      pressure of her body against him. It shook him strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she murmured. And, a moment later, &ldquo;Good-night,
      and thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the hand which she held out, he returned her good-night. The door
      closed. He turned away and was halfway down the flight when a sudden
      thought recalled him. He tapped on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the serene music of the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to bother you, but there&rsquo;s just one thing
      I forgot. Please give me your name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; returned the voice doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must report it to the company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; The voice seemed to be vaguely troubled. &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give a thought to it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-morrow
      will do just as well. I&rsquo;m sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t remember her own name!&rdquo; thought Banneker, moved
      and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness and quiet were grateful to him as he entered the office. By sense
      of direction he found his chair, and sank into it. Overhead he could hear
      the soft sound of her feet moving about the room, his room. Quiet
      succeeded. Banneker, leagues removed from sleep, or the hope of it,
      despite his bodily weariness, followed the spirit of wonder through
      starlit and sunlit realms of dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegraph-receiver clicked. Not his call. But it brought him back to
      actualities. He lighted his lamp and brought down the letter-file from
      which had been extracted the description of the wreck for Gardner of the
      Angelica City Herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing out the special paper, he looked at the heading and smiled.
      &ldquo;Letters to Nobody.&rdquo; He took a fresh sheet and began to write.
      Through the night he wrote and dreamed and dozed and wrote again. When a
      sound of song, faint and sweet and imminent, roused him to lift his
      sleep-bowed head from the desk upon which it had sunk, the gray, soiled
      light of a stormy morning was in his eyes. The last words he had written
      were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breast of the world rises and falls with your breathing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was twenty-four years old, and had the untainted soul of a boy of
      sixteen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Overhead she was singing. The voice was clear and sweet and happy. He did
      not know the melody; some minor refrain of broken rhythm which seemed
      always to die away short of fulfillment. A haunting thing of mystery and
      glamour, such mystery and glamour as had irradiated his long and wonderful
      night. He heard the door open and then her light footsteps on the stair
      outside. Hot-eyed and disheveled, he rose, staggering a little at first as
      he hurried to greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood poised on the lower step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no return to his accost other than a slow smile. &ldquo;I thought
      you were a dream,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m real enough. Are you better? Your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put a hand to the bandage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sore. Otherwise I&rsquo;m
      quite fit. I&rsquo;ve slept like the dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; he replied mechanically. He was
      drinking her in, all the grace and loveliness and wonder of her, himself
      quite unconscious of the intensity of his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted the mute tribute untroubled; but there was a suggestion of
      puzzlement in the frown which began to pucker her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really the station-agent?&rdquo; she asked with a
      slight emphasis upon the adverb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. No reason. Won&rsquo;t you tell me what happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo; He held open the door against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s musty.&rdquo; She wrinkled a dainty nose. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      we talk here? I love the feel of the air and the wet. And the world! I&rsquo;m
      glad I wasn&rsquo;t killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my brain wouldn&rsquo;t work quite right yesterday, I thought
      that some one had hit me. That isn&rsquo;t so, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Your train was wrecked. You were injured. In the confusion you
      must have run away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I remember being frightened. Terribly frightened. I&rsquo;d
      never been that way before. Outside of that one idea of fear, everything
      was mixed up. I ran until I couldn&rsquo;t run any more and dropped down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up and ran again. Have you ever been afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realized before that there was anything in the world
      to be afraid of. But the thought of that blow, coming so suddenly from
      nowhere, and the fear that I might be struck again&mdash;it drove me.&rdquo;
      She flung out her hands in a little desperate gesture that twitched at
      Banneker&rsquo;s breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been out all night in the rain.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I found a sort of cabin in the woods. It was deserted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dutch Cal&rsquo;s place. It&rsquo;s only a few rods back in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a light from there and that suggested to my muddled brain
      that I might get something to eat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you came over here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But the fear came on me again and I didn&rsquo;t dare knock. I
      suppose I prowled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gardner thought he heard ghosts. But ghosts don&rsquo;t steal
      molasses pie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him solemnly. &ldquo;Must one steal to get anything to eat
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you
      breakfast right away. What will you have? There isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything there is. But if I&rsquo;m to board with you, you must let
      me pay my way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The company is responsible for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brooding eyes were still fixed upon him. &ldquo;You actually are the
      agent,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quaint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything quaint about it. Now, if you&rsquo;ll
      make yourself comfortable I&rsquo;ll go over to the shack and rustle
      something for breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d rather go with you. Perhaps I can help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such help as the guest afforded was negligible. When, from sundry of the
      Sears-Roebuck cans and bottles, a condensed and preserved sort of meal had
      been derived, she set to it with a good grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more of a kick in tea than in a cocktail, I believe,
      when you really need it,&rdquo; she remarked gratefully. &ldquo;You spoke
      of a Mr. Gardner. Who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter who spent night before last here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her cracker, oleomargarine-side down. &ldquo;A reporter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came down to write up the wreck. It&rsquo;s a bad one. Nine
      dead, so far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he still here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Gone back to Angelica City.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrieving her cracker, the guest finished her meal, heartily but
      thoughtfully. She insisted on lending a hand to the washing-up process,
      and complimented Banneker on his neatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me your name yet,&rdquo; he reminded her
      when the last shining tin was hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t. What will you do with it when you get it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Report it to the company for their lists.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t want it reported to the company?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have my reasons. Would it be put in the papers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> it in the papers,&rdquo; said the girl
      with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want it known that you&rsquo;re all right? Your
      people&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wire my people. Or you can wire them for me. Can&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But the company has a right to know what has happened to
      its passengers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to me! What has the company done for me but wreck me and give
      me an awful bang on the head and lose my baggage and&mdash;Oh, I nearly
      forgot. I took my traveling-bag when I ran. It&rsquo;s in the hut. I
      wonder if you would get it for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll go now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of you. And for your own self, but not your old
      company, I&rsquo;ll tell you my name. I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. Whatever you tell me I&rsquo;ll have to report.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she returned imperiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      in confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t accept it so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a most extraordinary sta&mdash;a most extraordinary
      sort of man. Then I&rsquo;ll give you this much for yourself, and if your
      company collects pet names, you can pass it on. My friends call me Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know. You&rsquo;re I.O.W.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? And how much more do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more. A man on the train reported your initials from your
      baggage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel ever so much better when I have that bag. Is there
      a hotel near here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of one at Manzanita. It isn&rsquo;t very clean. But there&rsquo;ll
      be a train through to-night and I&rsquo;ll get you space on that. I&rsquo;d
      better get a doctor for you first, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! All I need is some fresh things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker set off at a brisk pace. He found the extravagant little
      traveling-case safely closed and locked, and delivered it outside his own
      door which was also closed and, he suspected, locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said the soft voice of the girl within.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt your work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath, at his routine, Banneker also set himself to think; confused,
      bewildered, impossibly conjectural thoughts not unmingled with
      semi-official anxiety. Harboring a woman on company property, even though
      she were, in some sense, a charge of the company, might be open to
      misconceptions. He wished that the mysterious Io would declare herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon she did. She declared herself ready for luncheon. There was about
      her a matter-of-fact acceptance of the situation as natural, even
      inevitable, which entranced Banneker when it did not appall him. After the
      meal was over, the girl seated herself on a low bench which Banneker had
      built with his own hands and the Right-and-Ready Tool Kit (9 T 603), her
      knee between her clasped hands and an elfish expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d
      get on quicker if you washed the dishes and I sat here and talked to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so easy to begin, you know,&rdquo; she remarked,
      nursing her knee thoughtfully. &ldquo;Am I&mdash;Do you find me very much
      in the way?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppress your wild enthusiasm on my account,&rdquo; she
      besought him. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t interfered with your duties so far,
      have I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Banneker wondering what was coming next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see&rdquo;&mdash;her tone became ruminative and confidential&mdash;&ldquo;if
      I give you my name and you report it, there&rsquo;ll be all kinds of a
      mix-up. They&rsquo;ll come after me and take me away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker dropped a tin on the floor and stood, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident enough that it&rsquo;s what <i>you</i> want,&rdquo;
      she returned, aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not at all,&rdquo; he disclaimed. &ldquo;Only&mdash;well, out
      here&mdash;alone&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that if one had happened to drop out of
      the world by chance, it might be desirable to stay out for a while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>you</i>? No; I can&rsquo;t understand that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo; she challenged with a swift, amused
      gleam. &ldquo;You are certainly staying out of the world here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes and voice dropped. &ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; she murmured. Then, as he
      made no reply, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much of a world for a man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this his response touched the heights of the unexpected. He stretched
      out his arm toward the near window through which could be seen the white
      splendor of Mount Carstairs, dim in the wreathing murk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo! For there, amidst the flowers and grasses, Only the mightier
      movement sounds and passes, Only winds and rivers, Life and death,&rdquo;
      he quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes glowed with sheer, incredulous astonishment. &ldquo;How came you
      by that Stevenson?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Are you poet as well as
      recluse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some other time. We&rsquo;ve other things to talk of now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some other time? Then I&rsquo;m to stay!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Manzanita?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manzanita? No. Here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this station? Alone? But why&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m Io Welland and I want to, and I always get what I
      want,&rdquo; she retorted calmly and superbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welland,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Miss I.O. Welland. And the
      address is New York, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands grew tense across her knee, and deep in her shadowed eyes there
      was a flash. But her voice suggested not only appeal, but almost a hint of
      caress as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to betray a guest? I&rsquo;ve always heard that
      Western hospitality&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my guest. You&rsquo;re the company&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t take me for yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be reasonable, Miss Welland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a question of the conventionalities,&rdquo;
      she mocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know or care anything about the conventionalities&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Out here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;but my guess would be that they apply only to people who
      live in the same world. We don&rsquo;t, you and I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather shrewd of you,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an easy matter to talk about to a young girl, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is,&rdquo; she returned with composure. &ldquo;Just
      take it for granted that I know about all there is to be known and am not
      afraid of it. I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything, I think, except of&mdash;of
      having to go back just now.&rdquo; She rose and went to him, looking down
      into his eyes. &ldquo;A woman knows whom she can trust in&mdash;in certain
      things. That&rsquo;s her gift, a gift no man has or quite understands.
      Dazed as I was last night, I knew I could trust you. I still know it. So
      we may dismiss that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Banneker, &ldquo;so far as it goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What farther is there? If it&rsquo;s a matter of the inconvenience&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You know it isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me stay in this funny little shack just for a few days,&rdquo;
      she pleaded. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll get on to-night&rsquo;s
      train and go on and&mdash;and do something I&rsquo;ll be sorry for all the
      rest of my life. And it&rsquo;ll be your fault! I was going to do it when
      the accident prevented. Do you believe in Providence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a butt-in,&rdquo; he answered promptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      believe that Providence would pitch a rock into a train and kill a lot of
      people, just to prevent a girl from making a foo&mdash;a bad break.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s some kind
      of a General Manager over this queer world; but I believe He plays the
      game fair and square and doesn&rsquo;t break the rules He has made
      Himself. If I didn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to play at all!... Oh,
      my telegram! I must wire my aunt in New York. I&rsquo;ll tell her that I&rsquo;ve
      stopped off to visit friends, if you don&rsquo;t object to that
      description as being too compromising,&rdquo; she added mischievously. She
      accepted a pad which he handed her and sat at the table, pondering.
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; she said after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the telegram goes from here, will it be headed by the name of
      the station?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that inquiry might be made here for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might, certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want it to be. Couldn&rsquo;t you leave off the
      station?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for me?&rdquo; she wheedled. &ldquo;For your guest that you&rsquo;ve
      been so insistent on keeping,&rdquo; she added slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message wouldn&rsquo;t be accepted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Then I won&rsquo;t send it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t notify your family, I must report you to the
      company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an irritating sense of duty you have! It must be dreadful to
      be afflicted that way. Can&rsquo;t you suggest something?&rdquo; she
      flashed. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do a <i>thing</i> to help me stay? I
      believe you don&rsquo;t want me, after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the up-train gets through this evening, I&rsquo;ll give your
      wire to the engineer and he&rsquo;ll transmit it from any office you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Childlike with pleasure she clapped her hands. &ldquo;Of course! Give him
      this, will you?&rdquo; From a bag at her wrist she extracted a five-dollar
      bill. &ldquo;By the way, if I&rsquo;m to be a guest I must be a paying
      guest, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can pay for a cot that I&rsquo;ll get in town,&rdquo; he
      agreed, &ldquo;and your share of the food.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the use of the house, and&mdash;and all the trouble I&rsquo;m
      making you,&rdquo; she said doubtfully. &ldquo;I ought to pay for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; He looked at her with a peculiar expression
      which, however, was not beyond the power of her intuition to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker answered her smile with his own, as he resumed his dish-wiping.
      Io wrote out her telegram with care. Her next observation startled the
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, by any chance, married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not. What makes you ask that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a woman in here before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Confusedly his thoughts flew back to Carlotta. But the Mexican girl had
      never been in the shack. He was quite absurdly and inexplicably glad now
      that she had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in the arrangement of the place. That hanging, yonder.
      And that little vase&mdash;it&rsquo;s good, by the way. The way that
      Navajo is placed on the door. One feels it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. A friend of mine came here one day and turned
      everything topsy-turvy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking questions just for curiosity. But is that the
      reason you didn&rsquo;t want me to stay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, thinking of Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;Heavens, no! Wait till
      you meet her. She&rsquo;s a very wonderful person; but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet her? Does she live near here, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few miles away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose she should come and find me here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been wishing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it! Well, it isn&rsquo;t what I wish at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; continued the imperturbable Banneker, &ldquo;I
      rather planned to ride over to her place this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you please?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell her about you and ask her advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io&rsquo;s face darkened rebelliously. &ldquo;Do you think it necessary to
      tattle to a woman who is a total stranger to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be wise to get her view,&rdquo; he replied,
      unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it would be horrid. I think if you do any such thing,
      you are&mdash;Mr. Banneker! You&rsquo;re not listening to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one is coming through the woods trail,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s your local friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please understand this, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; she said with an
      obstinate outthrust of her little chin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who your
      friend is and I don&rsquo;t care. If you make it necessary, I can go to
      the hotel in town; but while I stay here I won&rsquo;t have my affairs or
      even my presence discussed with any one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from a hardly discernible opening in the brush shouldered a big roan.
      Tossing up his head, he stretched out in the long, easy lope of the
      desert-bred, his rider sitting him loosely and with slack bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Van Arsdale,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Seated in her saddle the newcomer hailed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Ban? Is the wreck cleared up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But the track is out twenty miles east. Every arroyo and
      barranca is bank-high and over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had crossed the platform to her. Now she raised her deep-set, quiet
      eyes and rested them on the girl. That the station should harbor a visitor
      at that hour was not surprising. But the beauty of the stranger caught
      Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s regard, and her bearing held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A passenger, Ban?&rdquo; she asked, lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Camilla.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left over from the wreck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;You came in the nick of time. I don&rsquo;t quite know
      what to do with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she go on the relief train?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t show up until last night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did she stay the night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my room. I worked in the office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have brought her to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was hurt. Queer in the head. I&rsquo;m not sure that she isn&rsquo;t
      so yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale swung her tall form easily out of the saddle. The girl
      came forward at once, not waiting for Banneker&rsquo;s introduction, with
      a formal gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? I am Irene Welland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman took the extended hand. There was courtesy rather than
      kindliness in her voice as she asked, &ldquo;Are you much hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite over it, thank you. All but the bandage. Mr.
      Banneker was just speaking of you when you rode up, Miss Van Arsdale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled wanly. &ldquo;It is a little startling to hear one&rsquo;s
      name like that, in a voice from another world. When do you go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a point under discussion. Mr. Banneker would, I
      believe, summon a special train if he could, in his anxiety to get rid of
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; disclaimed the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Van Arsdale interrupted, addressing the girl:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be anxious, yourself, to get back to civilization.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; returned the girl lightly. &ldquo;This seems a
      beautiful locality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you traveling alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl flushed a little, but her eyes met the question without wavering.
      &ldquo;Quite alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the coast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To join friends there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they can patch up the washed-out track,&rdquo; put in Banneker,
      &ldquo;Number Seven ought to get through to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Banneker in his official capacity was almost ready to put
      me aboard by force, when I succeeded in gaining a reprieve. Now he calls
      you to his rescue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo; inquired Miss Van Arsdale with
      lifted brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here for a few days, in that funny little house.&rdquo; She
      indicated the portable shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s own place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would do, Miss Welland. It is <i>Miss</i>
      Welland, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it do, Miss Van Arsdale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite capable of taking care of myself,&rdquo; returned the
      girl calmly. &ldquo;As for Mr. Banneker, I assume that he is equally
      competent. And,&rdquo; she added with a smiling effrontery, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      quite as much compromised already as he could possibly be by my staying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker flushed angrily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question of my being
      compromised,&rdquo; he began shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Ban; there is,&rdquo; Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s
      quiet voice cut him short again. &ldquo;And still more of Miss Welland&rsquo;s.
      What sort of escapade this may be,&rdquo; she added, turning to the girl,
      &ldquo;I have no idea. But you cannot stay here alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; retorted the other mutinously. &ldquo;I think
      that rests with Mr. Banneker to say. Will you turn me out, Mr. Banneker?
      After our agreement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly kidnap me, even with all the conventionalities on
      your side,&rdquo; Miss Welland pointed out to Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady made no answer to the taunt. She was looking at the
      station-agent with a humorously expectant regard. He did not disappoint
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get an extra cot for the shack, Miss Van Arsdale,&rdquo; he
      asked, &ldquo;could you get your things and come over here to stay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be treated like a child!&rdquo; cried the derelict in
      exactly the tone of one, and a very naughty one. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t! I
      won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She stamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a coward,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the hotel in the town and stay there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think twice before you do that,&rdquo; advised the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Io, struck by the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crawly things,&rdquo; replied Miss Van Arsdale sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big, hungry ones,&rdquo; added Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could almost feel the little rippling shudders passing across the girl&rsquo;s
      delicate skin. &ldquo;Oh, I think you&rsquo;re <i>loathly</i>!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Both of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears of vexation made lucent the shadowed depths of her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      never been treated so in my life!&rdquo; she declared, overcome by the
      self-pity of a struggling soul trammeled by the world&rsquo;s injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not be sensible and stay with me to-night while you think it
      all over?&rdquo; suggested Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned the other with an unexpected and
      baffling change to the amenable and formal &ldquo;You are very kind. I&rsquo;d
      be delighted to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack up your things, then, and I&rsquo;ll bring an extra horse from
      the town. I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl went up to Banneker&rsquo;s room, and got her few belongings
      together. Descending she found the agent busy among his papers. He put
      them aside and came out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your telegram ought to get off from Williams sometime to-morrow,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be time enough,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be any answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can there be? I haven&rsquo;t given any address.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could wire Williams later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered. I want to be let alone. I&rsquo;m
      tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a glance about the lowering horizon. &ldquo;More rain coming,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;I wish you could have seen the desert in the sunshine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;It may be quite a while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Miss Van Arsdale will keep me, as you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;You know that it isn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t
      want you to stay. But she is right. It just wouldn&rsquo;t do.... Here she
      comes now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io took a step nearer to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking at your
      books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned her gaze unembarrassed. &ldquo;Odds and ends,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t find much to interest you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. Everything interested me. You&rsquo;re a mystery&mdash;and
      I hate mysteries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until they&rsquo;re solved. Perhaps I shall stay until I solve you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay longer. It wouldn&rsquo;t take any time at all. There&rsquo;s
      no mystery to solve.&rdquo; He spoke with an air of such perfect candor as
      compelled her belief in his sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll solve it for me. Here&rsquo;s Miss Van
      Arsdale. Good-bye, and thank you. You&rsquo;ll come and see me? Or shall I
      come and see you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; smiled Banneker. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fairest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair rode away leaving the station feeling empty and unsustained. At
      least Banneker credited it with that feeling. He tried to get back to
      work, but found his routine dispiriting. He walked out into the desert,
      musing and aimless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell between the two women as they rode. Once Miss Welland stopped
      to adjust her traveling-bag which had shifted a little in the straps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is riding cross-saddle uncomfortable for you?&rdquo; asked Miss Van
      Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. I often do it at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly her mount, a thick-set, soft-going pony shied, almost unseating
      her. A gun had banged close by. Immediately there was a second report.
      Miss Van Arsdale dismounted, replacing a short-barreled shot-gun in its
      saddle-holster, stepped from the trail, and presently returned carrying a
      brace of plump, slate-gray birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wild dove,&rdquo; she said, stroking them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
      them a welcome addition to a meager bill of fare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be quite content with whatever you usually have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubted,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I live rather a frugal
      life. It saves trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to make you trouble. But you
      brought it upon yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By interfering. Exactly. How old are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! You have the aplomb of fifty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Experience,&rdquo; smiled the girl, flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the recklessness of fifteen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I abide by the rules of the game. And when I find myself&mdash;well,
      out of bounds, I make my own rules.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale shook her firmly poised head. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do.
      The rules are the same everywhere, for honorable people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honorable!&rdquo; There was a flash of resentful pride as the girl
      turned in the saddle to face her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no intention of preaching at you or of questioning you,&rdquo;
      continued the calm, assured voice. &ldquo;If you are looking for sanctuary&rdquo;&mdash;the
      fine lips smiled slightly&mdash;&ldquo;though I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t
      see why you should need it, this is the place. But there are rules of
      sanctuary, also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; surmised the girl, &ldquo;you want to know why I
      don&rsquo;t go back into the world at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came West to be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Delavan Eyre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the dun pony jumped, this time because a sudden involuntary
      contraction of his rider&rsquo;s muscles had startled him. &ldquo;What do
      you know of Delavan Eyre, Miss Van Arsdale?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I occasionally see a New York newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know who I am, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are the pet of the society column paragraphers; the famous
      Io&rsquo; Welland.&rdquo; She spoke with a curious intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you read the society news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a qualmish stomach. I see the names of those whom I used to
      know advertising themselves in the papers as if they had a shaving-soap or
      a chewing-gum to sell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of the game,&rdquo; returned the girl airily. &ldquo;The
      newcomers, the climbers, would give their souls to get the place in print
      that we get without an effort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you a bit vulgar?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But it&rsquo;s the way the game is played nowadays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With counters which you have let the parvenues establish for you.
      In my day we tried to keep out of the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever of you,&rdquo; approved the girl. &ldquo;The more you try to
      keep out, the more eager the papers are to print your picture. They&rsquo;re
      crazy over exclusiveness,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speculation, pro and con, as to who is going to marry whom, and who
      is about to divorce whom, and whether Miss Welland&rsquo;s engagement to
      Mr. Eyre is authentic, &lsquo;as announced exclusively in this column&rsquo;&mdash;more
      exclusiveness&mdash;; or whether&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Del Eyre that I came out here to marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Carter Holmesley. Of course you know about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By advertisement, also; the society-column kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you know, he couldn&rsquo;t keep out of the papers. He
      hates it with all his British soul. But being what he is, a prospective
      duke, an international poloist, and all that sort of thing, the reporters
      naturally swarm to him. Columns and columns; more pictures than a popular
      <i>danseuse</i>. And all without his lifting his hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Une mariage de reclame</i>,&rdquo; observed Miss Van Arsdale.
      &ldquo;Is it that that constitutes his charm for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s smile was still instinct with mockery, but there
      had crept into it a quality of indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl. Her face became thoughtful and
      serious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something else. He&mdash;he carried me off my
      feet from the moment I met him. He was drunk, too, that first time. I don&rsquo;t
      believe I&rsquo;ve ever seen him cold sober. But it&rsquo;s a joyous kind
      of intoxication; vine-leaves and Bacchus and that sort of thing &lsquo;weave
      a circle &lsquo;round him thrice&rsquo;&mdash;<i>you</i> know. It <i>is</i>
      honey-dew and the milk of Paradise to him.&rdquo; She laughed nervously.
      &ldquo;And charm! It&rsquo;s in the very air about him. He can make me
      follow his lead like a little curly poodle when I&rsquo;m with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you engaged to Delavan Eyre when you met him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, engaged!&rdquo; returned the girl fretfully. &ldquo;There was
      never more than a sort of understanding. A <i>mariage de convenance</i> on
      both sides, if it ever came off. I <i>am</i> fond of Del, too. But he was
      South, and the other came like a whirlwind, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      queer about some things,&rdquo; she went on half shamefacedly. &ldquo;I
      suppose I&rsquo;m awfully susceptible to physical impressions. Are all
      girls that way? Or is that gross and&mdash;and underbred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of us, I expect; but we&rsquo;re not all so honest
      with ourselves. So you decided to throw over Mr. Eyre and marry your
      Briton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. The new British Ambassador, who arrives from Japan
      next week, is Carty&rsquo;s uncle, and we were going to make him
      stage-manage the wedding, you see. A sort of officially certified
      elopement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More advertisement!&rdquo; said Miss Van Arsdale coldly. &ldquo;Really,
      Miss Welland, if marriage seems to you nothing more than an opportunity to
      create a newspaper sensation I cannot congratulate you on your prospects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time her tone stung. Io Welland&rsquo;s eyes became sullen. But her
      voice was almost caressingly amiable as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tastes differ. It is, I believe, possible to create a sensation in
      New York society without any newspaper publicity, and without at all
      meaning or wishing to. At least, it was, fifteen years ago; so I&rsquo;m
      told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s face was white and lifeless and still, as she
      turned it toward the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been a very precocious five-year-old,&rdquo; she said
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the Olneys are precocious. My mother was an Olney, a first
      cousin of Mrs. Willis Enderby, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I remember now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The malicious smile on the girl&rsquo;s delicate lips faded. &ldquo;I wish
      I, hadn&rsquo;t said that,&rdquo; she cried impulsively. &ldquo;I hate
      Cousin Mabel. I always have hated her. She&rsquo;s a cat. And I think the
      way she, acted in&mdash;in the&mdash;the&mdash;well, about Judge Enderby
      and&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s tone was peremptory.
      &ldquo;Here is my place.&rdquo; She indicated a clearing with a little
      nest of a camp in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go back?&rdquo; asked Io remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale dismounted and, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitancy, the
      other followed her example. The hostess threw open the door and a
      beautiful, white-ruffed collie rushed to her with barks of joy. She held
      out a hand to her new guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be welcome,&rdquo; she said with a certain stately gravity, &ldquo;for
      as long as you will stay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be some time,&rdquo; answered Io shyly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      tempting me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is your wedding?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wedding! Oh, didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I&rsquo;m not going to marry
      Carter Holmesley either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The bump on my head must have settled my brain. As soon as I
      came to I saw how crazy it would be. That is why I don&rsquo;t want to go
      on West.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. For fear of his overbearing you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Though I don&rsquo;t think he could now. I think I&rsquo;m
      over it. Poor old Del! He&rsquo;s had a narrow escape from losing me. I
      hope he never hears of it. Placid though he is, that might stir him up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll go back to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed. &ldquo;I suppose so. How can I tell? I&rsquo;m only
      twenty, and it seems to me that somebody has been trying to marry me ever
      since I stopped petting my dolls. I&rsquo;m tired of men, men, men! That&rsquo;s
      why I want to live alone and quiet for a while in the station-agent&rsquo;s
      shack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t consider Mr. Banneker as belonging to the
      tribe of men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an official. I could always see his uniform, at need.&rdquo;
      She fell into thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious thing,&rdquo; she
      mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This queer young cub of a station-agent of yours is strangely like
      Carter Holmesley, not as much in looks as in&mdash;well&mdash;atmosphere.
      Only, he&rsquo;s ever so much better-looking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have some tea? You must be tired,&rdquo; said Miss
      Van Arsdale politely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere within the soul of civilized woman burns a craving for that
      higher power of sensation which we dub sensationalism. Girls of Io Welland&rsquo;s
      upbringing live in an atmosphere which fosters it. To outshine their
      rivals in the startling things which they do, always within accepted
      limits, is an important and exciting phase of existence. Io had run away
      to marry the future Duke of Carfax, partly through the charm which a
      reckless, headlong, and romantic personality imposed upon her, but largely
      for the excitement of a reckless, headlong, and romantic escapade. The
      tragic interposition of the wreck seemed to her present consciousness,
      cooled and sobered by the spacious peace of the desert, to have been
      providential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her disclaimer made to Banneker she felt, deep within the placid
      acceptances of subconsciousness, that the destruction of a train was not
      too much for a considerate Providence to undertake on behalf of her petted
      and important self. She clearly realized that she had had a narrow escape
      from Holmesley; that his attraction for her was transient and
      unsubstantial, a surface magnetism without real value or promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her revulsion of feeling she thought affectionately of Delavan Eyre.
      There lay the safe basis of habitude, common interests, settled liking.
      True, he bored her at times with his unimpeachable good-nature, his easy
      self-assurance that everything was and always would be &ldquo;all right,&rdquo;
      and nothing &ldquo;worth bothering over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If he knew of her escapade, that would at least shake him out of his soft
      and well-lined rut. Indeed, Io was frank enough with herself to admit that
      a perverse desire to explode a bomb under her imperturbable and
      too-assured suitor had been an element in her projected elopement. Never
      would that bomb explode. It would not even fizzle enough to alarm Eyre or
      her family. For not a soul knew of the frustrated scheme, except Holmesley
      and the reliable friend in Paradiso whom she was to visit; not her father,
      Sims Welland, traveling in Europe on business, nor her aunt, Mrs. Thatcher
      Forbes, in whose charge she had been left. Ostensibly she had been going
      to visit the Westerleys, that was all: Mrs. Forbes&rsquo;s misgivings as
      to a twenty-year-old girl crossing the continent alone had been unavailing
      against Io&rsquo;s calm willfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she would go back and marry Del Eyre, and be comfortable ever after.
      After all, liking and comprehension were a sounder foundation for
      matrimony than the perishable glamour of an attraction like Holmesley&rsquo;s.
      Any sensible person would know that. She wished that she had some older
      and more experienced woman to talk it out with. Miss Van Arsdale, if only
      she knew her a little better....
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale, even on so casual an acquaintance, would have told
      Io, reckoning with the slumbering fire in her eyes, and the sensitive and
      passionate turn of the lips, but still more with the subtle and
      significant emanation of a femininity as yet unawakened to itself, that
      for her to marry on the pallid expectancies of mere liking would be to
      invite disaster and challenge ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Io wanted to rest and think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time enough for that was to be hers, it appeared. Her first night as a
      guest had been spent in a semi-enclosed porch, to which every breeze
      wafted the spicy and restful balm of the wet pines. Io&rsquo;s hot brain
      cooled itself in that peace. Quite with a feeling of welcome she accepted
      the windy downpour which came with the morning to keep her indoors, as if
      it were a friendly and opportune jailer. Reaction from the mental strain
      and the physical shock had set in. She wanted only, as she expressed it to
      her hostess, to &ldquo;laze&rdquo; for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this is the ideal spot for you,&rdquo; Miss Van Arsdale
      answered her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ride over to town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this gale?&rdquo; asked the surprised girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m weather-proof. Tell Pedro not to wait luncheon for
      me. And keep an eye on him if you want anything fit to eat. He&rsquo;s the
      worst cook west of the plains. You&rsquo;ll find books, and the piano to
      amuse you when you get up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rode away, straight and supple in the saddle, and Io went back to
      sleep again. Halfway to her destination, Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s
      woods-trained ear caught the sound of another horse&rsquo;s hooves, taking
      a short cut across a bend in the trail. To her halloo, Banneker&rsquo;s
      clear voice responded. She waited and presently he rode up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back with me,&rdquo; she invited after acknowledging his
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going over to see Miss Welland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until to-morrow. She is resting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shade of disappointment crossed his face. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he
      agreed. &ldquo;I wanted to tell her that her messages got off all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her when I go back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be just as well,&rdquo; he answered reluctantly.
      &ldquo;How is she feeling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exhausted. She&rsquo;s been under severe strain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t she to have a doctor? I could ride&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t listen to it. And I think her head is all right
      now. But she ought to have complete rest for several days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m likely to be busy enough,&rdquo; he said simply.
      &ldquo;The schedule is all shot to pieces, and, unless this rain lets up,
      we&rsquo;ll have more track out. What do you think of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale looked up through the thrashing pines to the rush of the
      gray-black clouds. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re in for a siege of it,&rdquo;
      was her pronouncement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode along single file in the narrow trail until they emerged into
      the open. Then Banneker&rsquo;s horse moved forward, neck and neck with
      the other. Miss Van Arsdale reined down her uneasy roan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen anything like her before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on the stage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;What do you think of her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know how to express it,&rdquo; he answered frankly, though
      hesitantly. &ldquo;She makes me think of all the poetry I&rsquo;ve ever
      read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s dangerous. Ban, have you any idea what kind of a girl
      she is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo; he repeated. He looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you haven&rsquo;t. How should you? I&rsquo;m going to
      tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know her, Miss Camilla?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as if she were my own sister. That is, I know her type. It&rsquo;s
      common enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he protested eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! The type is. She is an exquisite specimen of it; that&rsquo;s
      all. Listen, Ban. Io Welland is the petted and clever and willful daughter
      of a rich man; a very rich man he would be reckoned out here. She lives in
      a world as remote from this as the moon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I realize that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well that you do. And she&rsquo;s as casual a visitant
      here as if she had floated down on one moonbeam and would float back on
      the next.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to, to get out of here if this rain keeps up,&rdquo;
      observed the station-agent grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she would,&rdquo; returned Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she in your way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind that if I could keep her out of yours,&rdquo;
      she answered bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker turned a placid and smiling face to her. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m
      a fool, don&rsquo;t you, Miss Camilla?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that Io Welland, without ill-intent at all, but with a
      period of idleness on her hands, is a dangerous creature to have around.
      She&rsquo;s too lovely and, I think, too restless a spirit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s lovely, all right,&rdquo; assented Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; I&rsquo;ve warned you, Ban,&rdquo; returned his friend in
      slightly dispirited tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do? Keep away from your place? I&rsquo;ll do
      whatever you say. But it&rsquo;s all nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it is,&rdquo; sighed Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;Forget
      that I&rsquo;ve said it, Ban. Meddling is a thankless business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could never meddle as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; said
      Banneker warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little worried,&rdquo; he added
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;about not reporting her as found to the company. What
      do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too official a question for me. You&rsquo;ll have to settle that
      for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long does she intend to stay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But a girl of her breeding and habits would
      hardly settle herself on a stranger for very long unless a point were made
      of urging her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t do that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose not. You&rsquo;ve been awfully good to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hospitality to the shipwrecked,&rdquo; smiled Miss Van Arsdale as
      she crossed the track toward the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late afternoon, darkening into wilder winds and harsher rain, brought the
      hostess back to her lodge dripping and weary. On a bearskin before the
      smouldering fire lay the girl, her fingers intertwined behind her head,
      her eyes half closed and dreamy. Without directly responding to the other&rsquo;s
      salutation she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Van Arsdale, will you be very good to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; said Io. &ldquo;So tired!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, of course,&rdquo; responded the hostess, answering the
      implication heartily, &ldquo;as long as you will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two or three days, until I recover the will to do something.
      You&rsquo;re awfully kind.&rdquo; Io looked very young and childlike, with
      her languid, mobile face irradiated by the half-light of the fire. &ldquo;Perhaps
      you&rsquo;ll play for me sometime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Now, if you like. As soon as the chill gets out of my
      hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. And sing?&rdquo; suggested the girl diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fierce contraction of pain marred the serenity of the older woman&rsquo;s
      face. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said harshly. &ldquo;I sing for no one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; murmured the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing all day?&rdquo; asked Miss Van Arsdale,
      holding out her hands toward the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resting. Thinking. Scaring myself with bogy-thoughts of what I&rsquo;ve
      escaped.&rdquo; Io smiled and sighed. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t known how worn
      out I was until I woke up this morning. I don&rsquo;t think I ever before
      realized the meaning of refuge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll recover from the need of it soon enough,&rdquo;
      promised the other. She crossed to the piano. &ldquo;What kind of music do
      you want? No; don&rsquo;t tell me. I should be able to guess.&rdquo; Half
      turning on the bench she gazed speculatively at the lax figure on the rug.
      &ldquo;Chopin, I think. I&rsquo;ve guessed right? Well, I don&rsquo;t
      think I shall play you Chopin to-day. You don&rsquo;t need that kind of&mdash;of&mdash;well,
      excitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Musing for a moment over a soft mingling of chords she began with a little
      ripple of melody, MacDowell&rsquo;s lovely, hurrying, buoyant &ldquo;Improvisation,&rdquo;
      with its aeolian vibrancies, its light, bright surges of sound, sinking at
      the last into cradled restfulness. Without pause or transition she passed
      on to Grieg; the wistful, remote appeal of the strangely misnamed &ldquo;Erotique,&rdquo;
      plaintive, solemn, and in the fulfillment almost hymnal: the brusque
      pursuing minors of the wedding music, and the diamond-shower of notes of
      the sun-path song, bleak, piercing, Northern sunlight imprisoned in
      melody. Then, the majestic swing of Åse&rsquo;s death-chant, glorious and
      mystical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; asked the player, speaking through the
      chords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Io&rsquo;s tremulous voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      being very unhappy. I love it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang! It was a musical detonation, followed by a volley of chords and then
      a wild, swirling waltz; and Miss Van Arsdale jumped up and stood over her
      guest. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than
      letting you pamper yourself with the indulgence of unhappiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to be unhappy,&rdquo; pouted Io. &ldquo;I want to be
      pampered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. You always will be, I expect, as long as there are men
      in the world to do your bidding. However, I must see to supper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So for two days Io Welland lolled and lazed and listened to Miss Van
      Arsdale&rsquo;s music, or read, or took little walks between showers. No
      further mention was made by her hostess of the circumstances of the visit.
      She was a reticent woman; almost saturnine, Io decided, though her perfect
      and effortless courtesy preserved her from being antipathetic to any one
      beneath her own roof. How much her silence as to the unusual situation was
      inspired by consideration for her guest, how much due to natural reserve,
      Io could not estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little less reticence would have been grateful to her as the hours spun
      out and she felt her own spirit expand slowly in the calm. It was she who
      introduced the subject of Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our quaint young station-agent seems to have abandoned his
      responsibilities so far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he hasn&rsquo;t come to see you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He said he would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him not to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Io, after thinking it over. &ldquo;Is he a
      little&mdash;just a wee, little bit queer in his head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the sanest persons I&rsquo;ve ever known. And I
      want him to stay so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see again,&rdquo; stated the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you thought him a bit unbalanced? That <i>is</i> amusing.&rdquo;
      That the hostess meant the adjective in good faith was proved by her quiet
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io regarded her speculatively and with suspicion. &ldquo;He asked the same
      about me, I suppose.&rdquo; Such was her interpretation of the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he gave you credit for being only temporarily deranged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either he or I ought to be up for examination by a medical board,&rdquo;
      stated the girl poutingly. &ldquo;One of us must be crazy. The night that
      I stole his molasses pie&mdash;it was pretty awful pie, but I was starved&mdash;I
      stumbled over something in the darkness and fell into it with an awful
      clatter. What do you suppose it was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could guess,&rdquo; smiled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you knew. Personally I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It
      felt like a boat, and it rocked like a boat, and there were the seats and
      the oars. I could feel them. A steel boat! Miss Van Arsdale, it isn&rsquo;t
      reasonable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it reasonable?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked on the map in his room and there isn&rsquo;t so much as a
      mud-puddle within miles and miles and miles. Is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what does he want of a steel boat?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might stir him up. They get violent if you question their pet
      lunacies, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite simple. Ban is just an incurable romanticist. He
      loves the water. And his repository of romance is the catalogue of Sears,
      Roebuck and Co. When the new issue came, with an entrancing illustration
      of a fully equipped steel boat, he simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it. He had
      to have one, to remind him that some day he would be going back to the
      coast lagoons.... Does that sound to you like a fool?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it sounds delicious,&rdquo; declared the girl with a ripple of
      mirth. &ldquo;What a wonderful person! I&rsquo;m going over to see him
      to-morrow. May I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear; I have no control over your actions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made any other plans for me to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
      inquired Miss Welland in a prim and social tone, belied by the dancing
      light in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that he was romantic,&rdquo; warned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What higher recommendation could there be? I shall sit in the boat
      with him and talk nautical language. Has he a yachting cap? Oh, do tell me
      that he has a yachting cap!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale, smiling, shook her head, but her eyes were troubled.
      There was compunction in Io&rsquo;s next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really going over to see about accommodations. Sooner or
      later I must face the music&mdash;meaning Carty. I&rsquo;m fit enough now,
      thanks to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t an Eastern trip be safer?&rdquo; suggested her
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Eastern trip would be easier. But I&rsquo;ve made my break, and
      it&rsquo;s in the rules, as I understand them, that I&rsquo;ve got to see
      it through. If he can get me now&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a little shrug&mdash;&ldquo;but
      he can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve come to my senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight pale, dubious, filtering through the shaken cloud veils, ushered
      in the morning. Meager of promise though it was, Io&rsquo;s spirits
      brightened. Declining the offer of a horse in favor of a pocket compass,
      she set out afoot, not taking the trail, but forging straight through the
      heavy forest for the line of desert. Around her, brisk and busy flocks of
      piñon jays darted and twittered confidentially. The warm spice of the
      pines was sweet in her nostrils. Little stirrings and rustlings just
      beyond the reach of vision delightfully and provocatively suggested the
      interest which she was inspiring by her invasion among the lesser denizens
      of the place. The sweetness and intimacy of an unknown life surrounded
      her. She sang happily as she strode, lithe and strong and throbbing with
      unfulfilled energies and potencies, through the springtide of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she emerged upon the desert, she fell silent. A spaciousness as
      of endless vistas enthralled and, a little, awed her. On all sides were
      ranged the disordered ranks of the cacti, stricken into immobility in the
      very act of reconstituting their columns, so that they gave the effect of
      a discord checked on the verge of its resolution into form and harmony,
      yet with a weird and distorted beauty of its own. From a little distance,
      there came a murmur of love-words. Io moved softly forward, peering
      curiously, and from the arc of a wide curving ocatilla two wild doves
      sprang, leaving the branch all aquiver. Bolder than his companions of the
      air, a cactus owl, perched upon the highest column of a great green
      candelabrum, viewed her with a steady detachment, &ldquo;sleepless, with
      cold, commemorative eyes.&rdquo; The girl gave back look for look, into
      the big, hard, unwavering circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a funny little bird,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Say
      something!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his congener of the hortatory poem, the owl held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re a stuffed little bird,&rdquo; said Io, &ldquo;and
      this not a real desert at all, but a National Park or something, full of
      educational specimens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked past the occupant of the cactus, and his head, turning,
      followed her with the slow, methodical movement of a toy mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me a crick in my neck,&rdquo; protested the intruder
      plaintively. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll step over behind you and you&rsquo;ll
      <i>have</i> to move or stop watching me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked behind the watcher. The eyes continued to hold her in direct
      range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Io, &ldquo;I know where the idea for that horrid
      advertisement that always follows you with its finger came from. However,
      I&rsquo;ll fix you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She fetched a deliberate circle. The bird&rsquo;s eyes followed her
      without cessation. Yet his feet and body remained motionless. Only the
      head had turned. That had made a complete revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very queer desert,&rdquo; gasped Io. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      bewitched. Or am I? Now, I&rsquo;m going to walk once more around you,
      little owl, or mighty magician, whichever you are. And after I&rsquo;ve
      completely turned your head, you&rsquo;ll fall at my feet. Or else...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she walked around the feathered center of the circle. The head
      followed her, turning with a steady and uninterrupted motion, on its
      pivot. Io took a silver dime from her purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven save us from the powers of evil!&rdquo; she said
      appreciatively. &ldquo;Aroint thee, witch!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw the coin at the cactus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chrr-rr-rrum!&rdquo; burbled the owl, and flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dizzy,&rdquo; said Io. &ldquo;I wonder if the owl is an
      omen and whether the other inhabitants of this desert are like him;
      however much you turn their heads, they won&rsquo;t fall for you. Charms
      and counter-charms!... Be a good child, Io,&rdquo; she admonished herself.
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got yourself into enough trouble with your
      deviltries? I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she defended herself. &ldquo;When
      I see a new and interesting specimen, I&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to
      investigate its nature and habits. It&rsquo;s an inherited scientific
      spirit, I suppose. And he is new, and awfully interesting&mdash;even if he
      is only a station-agent.&rdquo; Wherefrom it will be perceived that her
      thoughts had veered from the cactus owl, to another perplexing local
      phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glaring line of the railroad right-of-way rose before her feet, a
      discordant note of rigidity and order in the confused prodigality of
      desert growth. Io turned away from it, but followed its line until she
      reached the station. No sign of life greeted her. The door was locked, and
      the portable house unresponsive to her knocking. Presently, however, she
      heard the steady click of the telegraph instrument and, looking through
      the half-open office window, saw Banneker absorbed in his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking up he gave back her greeting in an absent echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you didn&rsquo;t come to see me, I&rsquo;ve come to see you,&rdquo;
      was her next attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he nod? Or had he made no motion at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask important questions about trains,&rdquo; she
      pursued, a little aggrieved by his indifference to her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply from the intent worker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;tell sad stories of the death of kings,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      she quoted with a fairy chuckle. She thought that she saw a small
      contortion pass over his features, only to be banished at once. He had
      retired within the walls of that impassive and inscrutable reserve which
      minor railroad officials can at will erect between themselves and the lay
      public. Only the broken rhythms of the telegraph ticker relieved the
      silence and furnished the justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little piqued but more amused, for she was far too confident of herself
      to feel snubbed, the girl waited smilingly. Presently she said in silken
      tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re quite through and can devote a little attention
      to insignificant me, I shall perhaps be sitting on the sunny corner of the
      platform, or perhaps I shall be gone forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not gone when, ten minutes later, Banneker came out. He looked
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, you weren&rsquo;t very polite to me,&rdquo; she remarked,
      glancing at him slantwise as he stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she expected apologies, she was disappointed, and perhaps thought none
      the less of him for his dereliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble all up and down the line,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Nothing like a schedule left west of Allbright. Two passenger
      trains have come through, though. Would you like to see a paper? It&rsquo;s
      in my office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness, no! Why should I want a newspaper here? I haven&rsquo;t
      time for it. I want to see the world&rdquo;&mdash;she swept a little,
      indicating hand about her; &ldquo;all that I can take in in a day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be. Ten to one there&rsquo;s no space to be
      had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you can get something for me. A section will do if you can&rsquo;t
      get a stateroom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;The president of the road might get a stateroom. I doubt
      if anybody else could even land an upper. Of course I&rsquo;ll do my best.
      But it&rsquo;s a question when there&rsquo;ll be another train through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails your road?&rdquo; she demanded indignantly. &ldquo;Is it
      just stuck together with glue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen this desert country when it springs a leak.
      It can develop a few hundred Niagaras at the shortest notice of any place
      I know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t leaking now,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his face to the softly diffused sunlight. &ldquo;To be
      continued. The storm isn&rsquo;t over yet, according to the way I feel
      about it. Weather reports say so, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take me for a walk!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired
      of rain and I want to go over and lean against that lovely white mountain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only sixty miles away,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Perhaps
      you&rsquo;d better take some grub along or you might get hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my busy morning. If it were afternoon, now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Since you are so urgent, I <i>will</i> stay to luncheon.
      I&rsquo;ll even get it up myself if you&rsquo;ll let me into the shack.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; said Banneker heartily. &ldquo;What about
      your horse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; did you?&rdquo; He turned thoughtful, and his next observation
      had a slightly troubled ring. &ldquo;Have you got a gun?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gun? Oh, you mean a pistol. No; I haven&rsquo;t. Why should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;This is no time to be out in the open without a
      gun. They had a dance at the Sick Coyote in Manzanita last night, and
      there&rsquo;ll be some tough specimens drifting along homeward all day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you carry a gun?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would if I were going about with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can loan me yours to go home with this afternoon,&rdquo;
      she said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take you back. Just now I&rsquo;ve got some odds and
      ends that will take a couple of hours to clear up. You&rsquo;ll find
      plenty to read in the shack, such as it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus casually dismissed, Io murmured a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; which was
      not as meek as it sounded, and withdrew to rummage among the canned
      edibles drawn from the inexhaustible stock of Sears-Roebuck. Having laid
      out a selection, housewifely, and looked to the oil stove derived from the
      same source, she turned with some curiosity to the mental pabulum with
      which this strange young hermit had provided himself. Would this, too,
      bear the mail-order imprint and testify to mail-order standards? At first
      glance the answer appeared to be affirmative. The top shelf of the
      home-made case sagged with the ineffable slusheries of that most popular
      and pious of novelists, Harvey Wheelwright. Near by, &ldquo;How to Behave
      on All Occasions&rdquo; held forth its unimpeachable precepts, while a
      little beyond, &ldquo;Botany Made Easy&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Perfect
      Letter Writer&rdquo; proffered further aid to the aspiring mind.
      Improvement, stark, blatant Improvement, advertised itself from that
      culturous and reeking compartment. But just below&mdash;Io was tempted to
      rub her eyes&mdash;stood Burton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anatomy of Melancholy&rdquo;;
      a Browning, complete; that inimitably jocund fictional prank, Frederic&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;March Hares,&rdquo; together with the same author&rsquo;s fine and
      profoundly just &ldquo;Damnation of Theron Ware&rdquo;; Taylor&rsquo;s
      translation of Faust; &ldquo;The [broken-backed] Egoist&rdquo;; &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;
      (Io touched its magic pages with tender fingers), and a fat, faded,
      reddish volume so worn and obscured that she at once took it down and made
      explorative entry. She was still deep in it when the owner arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found enough to keep you amused?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up from the pages and seemed to take him all in anew before
      answering. &ldquo;Hardly the word. Bewildered would be nearer the feeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queerish library, I suppose,&rdquo; he said
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I believed in dual personality&mdash;&rdquo; she began; but
      broke off to hold up the bulky veteran. &ldquo;Where did you get &lsquo;The
      Undying Voices&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a windfall. What a bully title for a collection of
      the great poetries, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, one caressing hand on the open book, the other propping her
      chin as she kept the clear wonder of her eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes you think of singers making harmony together in a great
      open space. I&rsquo;d like to know the man who made the selections,&rdquo;
      he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a windfall?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A real one. Pullman travelers sometimes prop their windows open
      with books. You can see the window-mark on the cover of this one. I found
      it two miles out, beside the right-of-way. There was no name in it, so I
      kept it. It&rsquo;s the book I read most except one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, holding up the still more corpulent Sears-Roebuck catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said she gravely. &ldquo;That accounts, I suppose, for
      the top shelf.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mostly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like them? The Conscientious Improvers, I mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re bunk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you get them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose I was looking for something,&rdquo; he returned; and
      though his tone was careless, she noticed for the first time a tinge of
      self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find it there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; She laid both hands on the &ldquo;windfall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face lighted subtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> there, isn&rsquo;t it! If one has the sense to get it
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; mused the girl. And again, &ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;
      She rose, and taking out &ldquo;March Hares&rdquo; held it up. &ldquo;I
      could hardly believe this when I saw it. Did it also drop out of a car
      window?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I never heard of that until I wrote for it. I wrote to a Boston
      bookstore that I&rsquo;d heard about and told &rsquo;em I wanted two books
      to cheer up a fool with the blues, and another to take him into a strange
      world&mdash;and keep the change out of five dollars. They sent me &lsquo;The
      Bab Ballads&rsquo; and this, and &lsquo;Lavengro.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I&rsquo;d like to see that letter! If the bookstore has an
      ounce of real bookitude about it, they&rsquo;ve got it preserved in
      lavender! And what do you think of &lsquo;March Hares&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever read any of the works of Harvey Wheelwright?&rdquo; he
      questioned in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Io, &ldquo;he is going to compare Frederic to
      Wheelwright, and I shall abandon him to his fate forever. So here&rsquo;s
      his chance ... I have,&rdquo; she replied aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; ruminated Banneker. &ldquo;Mr. Wheelwright
      writes about the kind of things that might happen any day, and probably do
      happen, and yet you don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. &lsquo;March Hares&rsquo;&mdash;well,
      it just couldn&rsquo;t happen; but what do you care while you&rsquo;re in
      it! It seems realer than any of the dull things outside it. That&rsquo;s
      the literary part of it, I suppose, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the magic of it,&rdquo; returned Io, with a little,
      half-suppressed crow of delight. &ldquo;Are you magic, too, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive the cook!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But just one thing more.
      Will you lend me the poetry book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all marked up,&rdquo; he objected, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid that I&rsquo;ll surprise your inmost secrets?&rdquo;
      she taunted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d be safe. I can be close-mouthed, even
      though I&rsquo;ve been chattering like a sparrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ve
      marked all the wrong things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re batting one hundred
      per cent as a literary critic.&rdquo; She poured coffee into a tin cup and
      handed it to him. &ldquo;What do you think of my coffee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tasted it consideringly; then gave a serious verdict. &ldquo;Pretty
      bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! I suppose it isn&rsquo;t according to the mail-order book
      recipe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s muddy and it&rsquo;s weak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you always so frank in your expression of views?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you asked me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you answer as plainly whatever I asked you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;d have too much respect for you not to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened wide eyes at this. Then provocatively: &ldquo;What do you think
      of me, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you well enough to give an opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me as well as you ever will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a snap judgment, for what it&rsquo;s worth.... What are you
      doing there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making more coffee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io stamped her foot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most enraging man I ever met.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite unintentional,&rdquo; he replied patiently, but
      with no hint of compunction. &ldquo;You may drink yours and I&rsquo;ll
      drink mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only making it worse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; then I&rsquo;ll drink yours if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say it&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; insisted Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvelous,&rdquo; agreed her unsmiling host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from being satisfied with words and tone, which were correctness
      itself, Io was insensately exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re treating me like a child,&rdquo; she charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you want me to treat you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a woman,&rdquo; she flashed, and was suddenly appalled to feel
      the blood flush incredibly to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he noted the phenomenon, he gave no sign, simply assenting with his
      customary equanimity. During the luncheon she chattered vaguely. She was
      in two minds about calling off the projected walk. As he set aside his
      half-emptied cup of coffee&mdash;not even tactful enough to finish it out
      of compliment to her brew&mdash;Banneker said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up beyond the turn yonder the right-of-way crosses an arroyo. I
      want to take a look at it. We can cut through the woods to get there. Are
      you good for three miles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a hundred!&rdquo; cried Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine of life was potent in her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before the walk was over, Io knew Banneker as she had never before, in her
      surrounded and restricted life, known any man; the character and evolution
      and essence of him. Yet with all his frankness, the rare, simple, and
      generous outgiving of a naturally rather silent nature yielding itself to
      an unrecognized but overmastering influence, he retained the charm of
      inner mystery. Her sudden understanding of him still did not enable her to
      place him in any category of life as she knew it to be arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revelation had come about through her description of her encounter
      with the queer and attentive bird of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been interviewing a
      cactus owl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he unwind his neck carefully and privately after I had gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Banneker gravely. &ldquo;He just jumped in the
      air and his body spun around until it got back to its original relation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How truly fascinating! Have you seen him do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not actually seen. But often in the evenings I&rsquo;ve heard them
      buzzing as they unspin the day&rsquo;s wind-up. During the day, you see,
      they make as many as ten or fifteen revolutions until their eyes bung out.
      Reversing makes them very dizzy, and if you are around when they&rsquo;re
      doing it, you can often pick them up off the sand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t it ever make <i>you</i> dizzy? All this local
      lore, I mean, that you carry around in your head?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much of a strain to a practiced intellect,&rdquo; he
      deprecated. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in natural history, there&rsquo;s
      the Side-hill Wampus&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know. I&rsquo;ve been West before, thank you! Pardon my
      curiosity, but are all you creatures of the desert queer and inexplicable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; he returned promptly if ungrammatically, &ldquo;if
      you&rsquo;re looking in my direction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that I find you as interesting as the owl&mdash;almost.
      And quite as hard to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever called me queer; not to my face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are, you know. You oughtn&rsquo;t to be here at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where ought I to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I answer that riddle without knowing where you have been?
      Are you Ulysses&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Knowing cities and the hearts of men,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
      answered, quick to catch the reference. &ldquo;No; not the cities,
      certainly, and very little of the men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see!&rdquo; she exclaimed plaintively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      up on a classical reference like a college man. No; not like the college
      men I know, either. They are too immersed in their football and rowing and
      too afraid to be thought high-brow, to confess to knowing anything about
      Ulysses. What was your college?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, sweeping a hand around the curve of the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in any one else,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;that would be
      priggish as well as disingenuous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I know what you mean. Out here, when a man doesn&rsquo;t
      explain himself, they think it&rsquo;s for some good reason of his own, or
      bad reason, more likely. In either case, they don&rsquo;t ask questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really beg your pardon, Mr. Banneker!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that isn&rsquo;t what I meant at all. If you&rsquo;re
      interested, I&rsquo;d like to have you know about me. It isn&rsquo;t much,
      though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think me prying,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you a sort of friend of a day, who is going away very soon
      leaving pleasant memories,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;A butterfly
      visit. I&rsquo;m not much given to talking, but if you&rsquo;d like it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sketched for her his history. His mother he barely remembered;
      &ldquo;dark, and quite beautiful, I believe, though that might be only a
      child&rsquo;s vision; my father rarely spoke of her, but I think all the
      emotional side of his life was buried with her.&rdquo; The father, an
      American of Danish ancestry, had been ousted from the chair of Sociology
      in old, conservative Havenden College, as the logical result of his
      writings which, because they shrewdly and clearly pointed out certain
      ulcerous spots in the economic and social system, were denounced as
      &ldquo;radical&rdquo; by a Board of Trustees honestly devoted to Business
      Ideals. Having a small income of his own, the ex-Professor decided upon a
      life of investigatory vagrancy, with special reference to studies, at
      first hand, of the voluntarily unemployed. Not knowing what else to do
      with the only child of his marriage, he took the boy along. Contemptuous
      of, rather than embittered against, an academic system which had dispensed
      with his services because it was afraid of the light&mdash;&ldquo;When you
      cast a light, they see only the resultant shadows,&rdquo; was one of his
      sayings which had remained with Banneker&mdash;he had resolved to educate
      the child himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their life was spent frugally in cities where they haunted libraries, or,
      sumptuously, upon the open road where a modest supply of ready cash goes a
      long way. Young Banneker&rsquo;s education, after the routine foundation,
      was curiously heterodox, but he came through it with his intellectual
      digestion unimpaired and his mental appetite avid. By example he had the
      competent self-respect and unmistakable bearing of a gentleman, and by
      careful precept the speech of a liberally educated man. When he was
      seventeen, his father died of a twenty-four hours&rsquo; pneumonia,
      leaving the son not so much stricken as bewildered, for their relations
      had been comradely rather than affectionate. For a time it was a question
      whether the youngster, drifting from casual job to casual job, would not
      degenerate into a veritable hobo, for he had drunk deep of the charm of
      the untrammeled and limitless road. Want touched him, but lightly; for he
      was naturally frugal and hardy. He got a railroad job by good luck, and it
      was not until he had worked himself into a permanency that his father&rsquo;s
      lawyers found and notified him of the possession of a small income, one
      hundred dollars per annum of which, they informed him, was to be expended
      by them upon such books as they thought suitable to his circumstances,
      upon information provided by the deceased, the remainder to be at his
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though quite unauthorized to proffer advice, as they honorably stated,
      they opined that the heir&rsquo;s wisest course would be to prepare
      himself at once for college, the income being sufficient to take him
      through, with care&mdash;and they were, his Very Truly, Cobb &amp; Morse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had not the smallest idea of cooping up his mind in a college. As
      to future occupation, his father had said nothing that was definite. His
      thesis was that observation and thought concerning men and their
      activities, pointed and directed by intimate touch with what others had
      observed and set down&mdash;that is, through books&mdash;was the gist of
      life. Any job which gave opportunity or leisure for this was good enough.
      Livelihood was but a garment, at most; life was the body beneath.
      Furthermore, young Banneker would find, so his senior had assured him,
      that he possessed an open sesame to the minds of the really intelligent
      wheresoever he might encounter them, in the form of a jewel which he must
      keep sedulously untarnished and bright. What was that? asked the boy. His
      speech and bearing of a cultivated man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Banneker found that it was almost miraculously true. Wherever he
      went, he established contacts with people who interested him and whom he
      interested: here a brilliant, doubting, perturbed clergyman, slowly dying
      of tuberculosis in the desert; there a famous geologist from Washington
      who, after a night of amazing talk with the young prodigy while awaiting a
      train, took him along on a mountain exploration; again an artist and his
      wife who were painting the arid and colorful glories of the waste places.
      From these and others he got much; but not friendship or permanent
      associations. He did not want them. He was essentially, though
      unconsciously, a lone spirit; so his listener gathered. Advancement could
      have been his in the line of work which had by chance adopted him; but he
      preferred small, out-of-the-way stations, where he could be with his books
      and have room to breathe. So here he was at Manzanita. That was all there
      was to it. Nothing very mysterious or remarkable about it, was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Io smiled in return. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Errol. But every one calls me Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever told this to any one before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know really,&rdquo; hesitated the girl, &ldquo;except
      that it seems almost inhuman to keep one&rsquo;s self so shut off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nobody else&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ve told it to me. That&rsquo;s very charming of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d be interested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am. It&rsquo;s an extraordinary life, though you don&rsquo;t
      seem to think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be extraordinary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; she refuted promptly. &ldquo;To be
      ordinary is&mdash;is&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s like being a dust-colored
      beetle.&rdquo; She looked at him queerly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Miss Van
      Arsdale know all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how she could. I&rsquo;ve never told her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s never asked you anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. I don&rsquo;t quite see Miss Camilla asking any one
      questions about themselves. Did she ask you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s color deepened almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a standard of breeding that
      we up-to-date people don&rsquo;t attain. But I&rsquo;m at least
      intelligent enough to recognize it. You reckon her as a friend, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I suppose so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose you&rsquo;d ever come to reckon me as one?&rdquo;
      she asked, half bantering, half wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be time. You&rsquo;re running away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I might write you. I think I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be greatly flattered,&rdquo; she reproved him. &ldquo;Instead
      you shoot a &lsquo;why&rsquo; at me. Well; because you&rsquo;ve got
      something I haven&rsquo;t got. And when I find anything new like that, I
      always try to get some of it for myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it could be, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it your philosophy of life. Your contentment. Or is it only
      detachment? That can&rsquo;t last, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her, vaguely disturbed as by a threat. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too&mdash;well, distinctive. You&rsquo;re too rare and
      beautiful a specimen. You&rsquo;ll be grabbed.&rdquo; She laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll grab me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know? Life, probably. Grab you and dry you up and put
      you in a case like the rest of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s why I like to stay out here. At least I can be
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your fondest ambition?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      However much he may have been startled by the swift stab, he gave no sign
      of hurt in his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it the line of least resistance. In any case, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      like to be grabbed and dried up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of us are grabbed and catalogued from our birth, and
      eventually dried up and set in our proper places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you, certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you haven&rsquo;t seen me in my shell. That&rsquo;s where I
      mostly live. I&rsquo;ve broken out for a time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it outside, Butterfly?&rdquo; he queried with
      a hint of playful caress in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that name for myself,&rdquo; she returned quickly. &ldquo;Though
      a butterfly couldn&rsquo;t return to its chrysalis, no matter how much it
      wanted to, could it? But you may call me that, since we&rsquo;re to be
      friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do like it outside your shell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exhilarating. But I suppose I should find it too rough
      for my highly sensitized skin in the long run.... Are you going to write
      to me if I write to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about? That Number Six came in making bad steam, and that a
      west-bound freight, running extra, was held up on the siding at Marchand
      for half a day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you have to write about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker bethought himself of the very private dossier in his office.
      &ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>could</i> write in a way all your own. Have you ever written
      anything for publication?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is&mdash;well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo; He
      told her about Gardner and the description of the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you happen to do that?&rdquo; she asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I write a lot of things and put them away and forget them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; she wheedled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t interest you.&rdquo; The
      words were those of an excuse. But in the tone was finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very responsive,&rdquo; she
      complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully interested in you and your affairs,
      and you won&rsquo;t play back the least bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence for a space. He had, she reflected, a most
      disconcerting trick of silence, of ignoring quite without embarrassment
      leads, which in her code imperatively called for return. Annoyance stirred
      within her, and the eternal feline which is a component part of the
      eternal feminine asserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;you are afraid of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that you mean &lsquo;Why should I be&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Miss Van Arsdale warn you against me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; he asked, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A solemn warning not to fall in love with me?&rdquo; pursued the
      girl calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short. &ldquo;She told you that she had said something to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be idiotic! Of course she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did you know?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does one snake know what another snake will do?&rdquo; she
      retorted. &ldquo;Being of the same&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. I don&rsquo;t like that word &lsquo;snake&rsquo; in
      connection with Miss Van Arsdale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though you&rsquo;re willing to accept it as applying to me. I
      believe you are trying to quarrel with me,&rdquo; accused Io. &ldquo;I
      only meant that, being a woman, I can make a guess at what another woman
      would do in any given conditions. And she did it!&rdquo; she concluded in
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she didn&rsquo;t. Not in so many words. But you&rsquo;re very
      clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, that <i>you</i> are very stupid,&rdquo; was the
      disdainful retort. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not going to fall in love with
      me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; answered Banneker in the most cheerfully
      commonplace of tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once embarked upon this primrose path, which is always an imperceptible
      but easy down-slope, Io went farther than she had intended. &ldquo;Why
      not?&rdquo; she challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brass buttons,&rdquo; said Banneker concisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed angrily. &ldquo;You <i>can</i> be rather a beast, can&rsquo;t
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beast? Just for reminding you that the Atkinson and St. Philip
      station-agent at Manzanita does not include in his official duties that of
      presuming to fall in love with chance passengers who happen to be more or
      less in his care.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very proper and official! Now,&rdquo; added the girl in a different
      manner, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stop talking nonsense, and do you tell me one
      thing honestly. Do you feel that it would be presumption?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fall in love with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that part of it out; I put my question stupidly. I&rsquo;m
      really curious to know whether you feel any&mdash;any difference between
      your station and mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do,&rdquo; she answered honestly, &ldquo;when I think of it.
      But you make it very hard for me to remember it when I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m a
      socialist in all matters of that kind. Not that I&rsquo;ve ever given much
      thought to them. You don&rsquo;t have to out here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you wouldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know that <i>you</i> would
      have to anywhere.... Are we almost home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three minutes&rsquo; more walking. Tired?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. You know,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I really would like
      it if you&rsquo;d write me once in a while. There&rsquo;s something here I&rsquo;d
      like to keep a hold on. It&rsquo;s tonic. I&rsquo;ll <i>make</i> you write
      me.&rdquo; She flashed a smile at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By sending you books. You&rsquo;ll have to acknowledge them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I couldn&rsquo;t take them. I&rsquo;d have to send them back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let me send you a book or two just as a friendly
      memento?&rdquo; she cried, incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take anything from anybody,&rdquo; he retorted
      doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; that&rsquo;s small-minded,&rdquo; she accused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      ungenerous. I wouldn&rsquo;t think that of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode along in moody thought for a few paces. Presently he turned to
      her a rigid face. &ldquo;If you had ever had to accept food to keep you
      alive, you&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she was shocked and sorry. Then her tact asserted itself.
      &ldquo;But I have,&rdquo; she said readily, &ldquo;all my life. Most of us
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard muscles around his mouth relaxed. &ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m not as real a socialist as I thought.
      Nevertheless, that rankles in my memory. When I got my first job, I swore
      I&rsquo;d never accept anything from anybody again. One of the passengers
      on your train tried to tip me a hundred dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been a fool,&rdquo; said Io scornfully.

    <p>
      Banneker held open the station-door for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to send
      a wire or two,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Take a look at this. It may give
      some news about general railroad conditions.&rdquo; He handed her the
      newspaper which had arrived that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out again, the station was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io was gone. So was the newspaper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Deep in work at her desk, Camilla Van Arsdale noted, with the outer
      tentacles of her mind, slow footsteps outside and a stir of air that told
      of the door being opened. Without lifting her head she called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find towels and a bathrobe in the passageway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. Miss Van Arsdale twisted in her chair, gave one look,
      rose and strode to the threshold where Io Welland stood rigid and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s hands gripped a folded newspaper. She lifted it as if for
      Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s acceptance, then let it fall to the floor. Her
      throat worked, struggling for utterance, as it might be against the
      pressure of invisible fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beast! Oh, the beast!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman threw an arm over her shoulders and led her to the big
      chair before the fireplace. Io let herself be thrust into it, stiff and
      unyielding as a manikin. Any other woman but Camilla Van Arsdale would
      have asked questions. She went more directly to the point. Picking up the
      newspaper she opened it. Halfway across an inside page ran the explanation
      of Io&rsquo;s collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRITON&rsquo;S BEAUTIFUL FIANCÉE LOST
    </p>
    <p>
      read the caption, in the glaring vulgarity of extra-heavy type, and below;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ducal Heir Offers Private Reward to Dinner Party of Friends</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      After an estimating look at the girl, who sat quite still with hot,
      blurred eyes, Miss Van Arsdale carefully read the article through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is advertising enough to satisfy the greediest appetite for
      print,&rdquo; she remarked grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on one of his brutal drunks.&rdquo; The words seemed to
      grit in the girl&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;I wish he were dead! Oh, I wish he
      were dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale laid hold on her shoulders and shook her hard. &ldquo;Listen
      to me, Irene Welland. You&rsquo;re on the way to hysterics or some such
      foolishness. I won&rsquo;t have it! Do you understand? Are you listening
      to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening. But it won&rsquo;t make any difference what
      you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me. Don&rsquo;t stare into nothingness that way. Have you
      read this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of it. It ends everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so, indeed. My dear!&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s voice
      changed and softened. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found that you cared for
      him, after all, more than you thought? It isn&rsquo;t that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s the beastliness of the whole
      thing. It&rsquo;s the disgrace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale turned to the paper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name isn&rsquo;t given.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might as well be. As soon as it gets back to New York, every one
      will know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I read correctly between the lines of this scurrilous thing, Mr.
      Holmesley gave what was to have been his bachelor dinner, took too much to
      drink, and suggested that every man there go on a separate search for the
      lost bride offering two thousand dollars reward for the one who found her.
      Apparently it was to have been quite private, but it leaked out. There&rsquo;s
      a hint that he had been drinking heavily for some days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fault,&rdquo; declared Io feverishly. &ldquo;He told me once
      that if ever I played anything but fair with him, he&rsquo;d go to the
      devil the quickest way he could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s a coward,&rdquo; pronounced Miss Van Arsdale
      vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I? I didn&rsquo;t play fair with him. I practically jilted
      him without even letting him know why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale frowned. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send him word?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I telegraphed him. I told him I&rsquo;d write and explain. I
      haven&rsquo;t written. How could I explain? What was there to say? But I
      ought to have said something. Oh, Miss Van Arsdale, why didn&rsquo;t I
      write!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did intend to go on and face him and have it out. You told
      me that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint tinge of color relieved the white rigidity of Io&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I did mean it. Now it&rsquo;s too
      late and I&rsquo;m disgraced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be melodramatic. And don&rsquo;t waste yourself in
      self-pity. To-morrow you&rsquo;ll see things clearer, after you&rsquo;ve
      slept.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep? I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She pressed both hands to her
      temples, lifting tragic and lustrous eyes to her companion. &ldquo;I think
      my head is going to burst from trying not to think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitancy Miss Van Arsdale went to a wall-cabinet, took out a
      phial, shook into her hand two little pellets, and returned the phial,
      carefully locking the cabinet upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a hot bath,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going
      to give you just a little to eat. And then these.&rdquo; She held out the
      drug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io acquiesced dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, before the first forelight of dawn had started the
      birds to prophetic chirpings, the recluse heard light movements in the
      outer room. Throwing on a robe she went in to investigate. On the bearskin
      before the flickering fire sat Io, an apparition of soft curves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;d&mdash;don&rsquo;t make a light,&rdquo; she whimpered.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been crying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. The best thing you could do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; wailed Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, too. Though perhaps you&rsquo;d better wait a
      little. Why, in particular do you want to go home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I w-w-w-want to m-m-marry Delavan Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quiver of humor trembled about the corners of Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s
      mouth. &ldquo;Echoes of remorse,&rdquo; she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t remorse. I want to feel safe, secure. I&rsquo;m
      afraid of things. I want to go to-morrow. Tell Mr. Banneker he must
      arrange it for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. Now you go back to bed and sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather sleep here,&rdquo; said Io. &ldquo;The fire is so
      friendly.&rdquo; She curled herself into a little soft ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hostess threw a coverlet over her and returned to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When light broke, there was no question of Io&rsquo;s going that day, even
      had accommodations been available. A clogging lassitude had descended upon
      her, the reaction of cumulative nervous stress, anesthetizing her will,
      her desires, her very limbs. She was purposeless, ambitionless, except to
      lie and rest and seek for some resolution of peace out of the tangled web
      wherein her own willfulness had involved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best possible thing,&rdquo; said Camilla Van Arsdale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      write your people that you are staying on for a visit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they won&rsquo;t mind. They&rsquo;re used to my vagaries. It&rsquo;s
      awfully good of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon came Banneker to see Miss Welland. Instead he found a curiously
      reticent Miss Van Arsdale. Miss Welland was not feeling well and could not
      be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not her head again, is it?&rdquo; asked Banneker, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More nerves, though the head injury probably contributed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t I to get a doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. All that she needs is rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She left the station yesterday without a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the non-committal Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over to tell her that there isn&rsquo;t a thing to be had
      going west. Not even an upper. There was an east-bound in this morning.
      But the schedule isn&rsquo;t even a skeleton yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably she won&rsquo;t be going for several days yet,&rdquo; said
      Miss Van Arsdale, and was by no means reassured by the unconscious
      brightness which illumined Banneker&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;When she goes it
      will be east. She&rsquo;s changed her plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me as much notice as you can and I&rsquo;ll do my best for
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. &ldquo;Did you get any newspapers by the train?&rdquo;
      she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there was a mail in. I had a letter, too,&rdquo; he added
      after a little hesitation, due to the fact that he had intended telling
      Miss Welland about that letter first. Thus do confidences, once begun,
      inspire even the self-contained to further confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there was a reporter up from Angelica City writing up the
      wreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gardner, his name is. A nice sort of fellow. I showed him some
      nonsense that I wrote about the wreck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? What kind of nonsense?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just how it struck me, and the queer things people said and
      did. He took it with him. Said it might give him some ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might suppose it would. Did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he didn&rsquo;t use it. Not that way. He sent it to the New
      York Sphere for what he calls a &lsquo;Sunday special,&rsquo; and what do
      you think! They accepted it. He had a wire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Gardner&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. As the impressions of an eye-witness. What&rsquo;s more,
      they&rsquo;ll pay for it and he&rsquo;s to send me the check.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in spite of a casual way of handling other people&rsquo;s
      ideas, Mr. Gardner apparently means to be honest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than square of him. I gave him the stuff to use as
      he wanted to. He could just as well have collected for it. Probably he
      touched it up, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Goths and Vandals usually did &lsquo;touch up&rsquo; whatever
      they acquired, I believe. Hasn&rsquo;t he sent you a copy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to send it. Or bring it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it? What should attract him to Manzanita again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something mysterious. He says that there&rsquo;s a big sensational
      story following on the wreck that he&rsquo;s got a clue to; a tip, he
      calls it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange. Where did this tip come from? Did he say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York, I think. He spoke of its being a special job for The
      Sphere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to help him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can. He&rsquo;s been white to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t white, if it&rsquo;s what I suspect. It&rsquo;s
      yellow. One of their yellow sensations. The Sphere goes in for that sort
      of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale became silent and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if it&rsquo;s something to do with the railroad I&rsquo;d
      have to be careful. I can&rsquo;t give away the company&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is.&rdquo; Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s troubled
      eyes strayed toward the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following them, Banneker&rsquo;s lighted up with a flash of astonished
      comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should the newspapers be after her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is associated with a set that is always in the lime-light,&rdquo;
      explained Miss Van Arsdale, lowering her voice to a cautious pitch.
      &ldquo;It makes its own lime-light. Anything that they do is material for
      the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what has she done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappeared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She sent back messages. So there can&rsquo;t be any
      mystery about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there might be what the howling headlines call &lsquo;romance.&rsquo;
      In fact, there is, if they happen to have found out about it. And this
      looks very much as if they had. Ban, are you going to tell your reporter
      friend about Miss Welland?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker smiled gently, indulgently. &ldquo;Do you think it likely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t. But I want you to understand the importance of
      not betraying her in any way. Reporters are shrewd. And it might be quite
      serious for her to know that she was being followed and hounded now. She
      has had a shock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bump on the head, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that. I think I&rsquo;d better tell you since we are all
      in this thing together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly she outlined the abortive adventure that had brought Io west, and
      its ugly outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Publicity is the one thing we must protect her from,&rdquo;
      declared Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s clear enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you tell this Gardner man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that he wants to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try to fool him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an awfully poor liar, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; replied the
      agent with his disarming smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the game and I&rsquo;m
      no good at it. But I can everlastingly hold my tongue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll suspect something and go nosing about the village
      making inquiries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him. Who can tell him anything? Who&rsquo;s even seen her
      except you and me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. Nobody is going to see her for some days yet if I can
      help it. Not even you, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she as bad as that?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be any the better for seeing people,&rdquo; replied
      Miss Van Arsdale firmly, and with that the caller was forced to be content
      as he went back to his own place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning train of the nineteenth, which should have been the noon train
      of the eighteenth, deposited upon the platform Gardner of the Angelica
      City Herald, and a suitcase. The thin and bespectacled reporter shook
      hands with Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Man,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a hit
      with that story of yours even before it&rsquo;s got into print.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you bring me a copy of the paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner grinned. &ldquo;You seem to think Sunday specials are set up and
      printed overnight. Wait a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re going to publish it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surest thing you know. They&rsquo;ve wired me to know who you are
      and what and why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dunno. Why a fellow who can do that sort of thing hasn&rsquo;t
      done it before or doesn&rsquo;t do it some more, I suppose. If you should
      ever want a job in the newspaper game, that story would be pretty much
      enough to get it for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting a little local correspondence to do,&rdquo;
      announced Banneker modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you intimated before. Well, I can give you some practice right
      now. I&rsquo;m on a blind trail that goes up in the air somewhere around
      here. Do you remember, we compared lists on the wreck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got any addition to your list since?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Banneker. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by name. But the tip is that there was a prominent New York
      society girl, one of the Four Hundred lot, on the train, and that she&rsquo;s
      vanished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the bodies were accounted for,&rdquo; said the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s dead. They think she&rsquo;s run
      away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away?&rdquo; repeated Banneker with an impassive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether the man was with her on the train or whether she was to
      join him on the coast isn&rsquo;t known. That&rsquo;s the worst of these
      society tips,&rdquo; pursued the reporter discontentedly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      always vague, and usually wrong. This one isn&rsquo;t even certain about
      who the girl is. But they think it&rsquo;s Stella Wrightington,&rdquo; he
      concluded in the manner of one who has imparted portentous tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Don&rsquo;t you ever read the news?&rdquo; cried the
      disgusted journalist. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s had her picture published
      more times than a movie queen. She&rsquo;s the youngest daughter of Cyrus
      Wrightington, the multi-millionaire philanthropist. Now did you see
      anything of that kind on the train?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she look like?&rdquo; asked the cautious Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like a million dollars!&rdquo; declared the other with
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a killer! She&rsquo;s tall and blonde and a
      great athlete: baby-blue eyes and general rosebud effect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of that sort on the train, so far as I saw,&rdquo; said the
      agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see any couple that looked lovey-dovey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, there&rsquo;s another tip that connects her up with Carter
      Holmesley. Know about him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been on a hell of a high-class drunk, all up and down
      the coast, for the last week or so. Spilled some funny talk at a dinner,
      that got into print. But he put up such a heavy bluff of libel, afterward,
      that the papers shied off. Just the same, I believe they had it right, and
      that there was to have been a wedding-party on. Find the girl: that&rsquo;s
      the stunt now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re likely to find her around here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not. But there&rsquo;s something. Holmesley has beaten it for
      the Far East. Sailed yesterday. But the story is still in this country, if
      the lady can be rounded up.... Well, I&rsquo;m going to the village to
      make inquiries. Want to put me up again for the night if there&rsquo;s no
      train back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing! There isn&rsquo;t likely to be, either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker felt greatly relieved at the easy turn given to the inquiry by
      the distorted tip. True, Gardner might, on his return, enter upon some
      more embarrassing line of inquiry; in which case the agent decided to take
      refuge in silence. But the reporter, when he came back late in the evening
      disheartened and disgusted with the fallibility of long-distance tips,
      declared himself sick of the whole business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about something else,&rdquo; he said, having
      lighted his pipe. &ldquo;What else have you written besides the wreck
      stuff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off! That thing was never a first attempt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nothing except random things for my own amusement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass &rsquo;em over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head. &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve never shown them to
      anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right. If you&rsquo;re shy about it,&rdquo; responded the
      reporter good-humoredly. &ldquo;But you must have thought of writing as a
      profession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaguely, some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t talk much like a country station-agent. And you don&rsquo;t
      act like one. And, judging from this room&rdquo;&mdash;he looked about at
      the well-filled book-shelves&mdash;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look like one.
      Quite a library. Harvey Wheelwright! Lord! I might have known. Great
      stuff, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I think so! I think it&rsquo;s the damndest spew that ever got
      into print. But it sells; millions. It&rsquo;s the piety touch does it.
      The worst of it is that Wheelwright is a thoroughly decent chap and not
      onto himself a bit. Thinks he&rsquo;s a grand little booster for
      righteousness, sweetness and light, and all that. I had to interview him
      once. Oh, if I could just have written about him and his stuff as it
      really is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s a popular literary hero out our way, and the
      biggest advertised author in the game. I&rsquo;d look fine to the business
      office, knocking their fat graft, wouldn&rsquo;t I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you wouldn&rsquo;t. Never mind. You will if you ever get into
      the game. Hello! This is something different again. &lsquo;The Undying
      Voices.&rsquo; Do you go in for poetry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to read it once in a while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good man!&rdquo; Gardner took down the book, which opened in his
      hand. He glanced into it, then turned an inquiring and faintly quizzical
      look upon Banneker. &ldquo;So Rossetti is one of the voices that sings to
      you. He sang to me when I was younger and more romantic. Heavens! he can
      sing, can&rsquo;t he! And you&rsquo;ve picked one of his finest for your
      floral decoration.&rdquo; He intoned slowly and effectively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, who shall dare to search in what sad maze Thenceforth their
      incommunicable ways Follow the desultory feet of Death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker took the book from him. Upon the sonnet a crushed bloom of the
      sage had left its spiced and fragrant stain. How came it there? Through
      but one possible agency of which Banneker could think. Io Welland!
    </p>
    <p>
      After the reporter had left him, Banneker bore the volume to his room and
      read the sonnet again and again, devout and absorbed, a seeker for the
      oracle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know when I&rsquo;m going home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io Welland looked up from beneath her dark lashes at her hostess with a
      mixture of mischief and deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Van Arsdale quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? Well, I would. Here it is two full weeks since I settled down
      on you. Why don&rsquo;t you evict me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale smiled. The girl continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I evict myself? I&rsquo;m quite well and sane again&mdash;at
      least I think so&mdash;thanks to you. Very well, then, Io; why don&rsquo;t
      you go home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instinct of self-preservation,&rdquo; suggested the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      better off here until your strength is quite restored, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl propped her chin in her hand and turned upon her companion a
      speculative regard. &ldquo;Camilla Van Arsdale, you don&rsquo;t really
      like me,&rdquo; she asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liking is such an undefined attitude,&rdquo; replied the other,
      unembarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find me diverting,&rdquo; defined Io. &ldquo;But you resent me,
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather acute in you. I don&rsquo;t like your standards
      nor those of your set.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve abandoned them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll resume them as soon as you get back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ever get back?&rdquo; The girl moved to the door. Her
      figure swayed forward yieldingly as if she would give herself into the
      keeping of the sun-drenched, pine-soaked air. &ldquo;Enchantment!&rdquo;
      she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a healing place,&rdquo; said the habitant of it, low, as if
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden and beautiful pity softened and sobered Io&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Miss
      Van Arsdale,&rdquo; said she with quiet sincerity; &ldquo;if there should
      ever come a time when I can do you a service in word or deed, I would come
      from the other side of the world to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a kindly, but rather exaggerated gratitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t gratitude. It&rsquo;s loyalty. Whatever you have
      done, I believe you were right. And, right or wrong, I&mdash;I am on your
      side. But I wonder why you have been so good to me. Was it a sort of class
      feeling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sex feeling would be nearer it,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;There
      is something instinctive which makes women who are alone stand by each
      other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io nodded. &ldquo;I suppose so. Though I&rsquo;ve never felt it, or the
      need of it before this. Well, I had to speak before I left, and I suppose
      I must go on soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss you,&rdquo; said the hostess, and added, smiling,
      &ldquo;as one misses a stimulant. Stay through the rest of the month,
      anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; answered Io gratefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      written Delavan that I&rsquo;m coming back&mdash;and now I&rsquo;m quite
      dreading it. Do you suppose there ever yet was a woman with understanding
      of herself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless she was a very dull and stupid woman with little to
      understand,&rdquo; smiled Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;What are you doing
      to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riding down to lunch with your paragon of a station-agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll
      miss his daily stimulant after you&rsquo;ve gone. It has been daily, hasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it has, just about,&rdquo; admitted the girl. &ldquo;The
      stimulus hasn&rsquo;t been all on one side, I assure you. What a mind to
      be buried here in the desert! And what an annoying spirit of contentment!
      It&rsquo;s that that puzzles me. Sometimes it enrages me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to spoil what you cannot replace?&rdquo; The retort
      was swift, almost fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, you won&rsquo;t blame me if he looks beyond this horizon,&rdquo;
      protested Io. &ldquo;Life is sure to reach out in one form or another and
      seize on him. I told him so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathed the other. &ldquo;You would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you intending to do with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hint of challenge in the slight emphasis given to the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Nothing. He is under no obligation to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you and he differ. He regards you as an infallible mentor.&rdquo;
      A twinkle of malice crept into the slumbrous eyes. &ldquo;Why do you let
      him wear made-up bow ties?&rdquo; demanded Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out here, nothing. But elsewhere&mdash;well, it does define a man,
      doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. I&rsquo;ve never gone into it with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I could guess why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. You seem preternaturally acute in these matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because the Sears-Roebuck mail-order double-bow knot in
      polka-dot pattern stands as a sign of pristine innocence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself Miss Van Arsdale laughed. &ldquo;Something of that
      sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io&rsquo;s soft lips straightened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten bad form. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t he be right? It&rsquo;s so easy. Just a hint&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From either of us. Yes; from me, if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite an intimate interest, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But never can battle of men compare With merciless feminine
      fray&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash; quoted Io pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kipling is a sophomore about women,&rdquo; retorted Miss Van
      Arsdale. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to quarrel over Errol Banneker. The
      odds are too unfair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfair?&rdquo; queried Io, with a delicate lift of brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I know that whatever you do will be
      within the rules of the game. That&rsquo;s the touchstone of honor of your
      kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it good enough? It ought to be, for it&rsquo;s about
      the only one most of us have.&rdquo; Io laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      becoming very serious. May I take the pony?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Will you be back for supper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Shall I bring the paragon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the gaunt box of the station, Io, from the saddle sent forth her
      resonant, young call:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the voice of the Butterfly; hear her declare, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      come down to the earth; I am tired of the air&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      chanted Banneker&rsquo;s voice in cheerful paraphrase. &ldquo;Light and
      preen your wings, Butterfly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their tone was that of comrades without a shade of anything deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy?&rdquo; asked Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now. Give me another five minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the hammock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One lone alamo tree, an earnest of spring water amongst the dry-sand
      growth of the cactus, flaunted its bright verdency a few rods back of the
      station, and in its shade Banneker had swung a hammock for Io. Hitching
      her pony and unfastening her hat, the girl stretched herself luxuriously
      in the folds. A slow wind, spice-laden with the faint, crisp fragrancies
      of the desert, swung her to a sweet rhythm. She closed her eyes happily
      ... and when she opened them, Banneker was standing over her, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I want to
      believe that this will last forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent and acquiescent, he seated himself in a camp-chair close by. She
      stretched a hand to him, closing her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swing me,&rdquo; she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He aided the wind to give a wider sweep to the hammock. Io stirred
      restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken the spell,&rdquo; she accused softly. &ldquo;Weave
      me another one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; He bent over the armful of books which he
      had brought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You choose this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he mused, regarding her consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you may well wonder! I&rsquo;m in a very special mood to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When aren&rsquo;t you, Butterfly?&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware that you don&rsquo;t spoil it. Choose well, or forever after
      hold your peace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the well-worn and well-loved volume of poetry. It parted in his
      hand to the Rossetti sonnet. He began to read at the lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Work and Will awake too late, to gaze After their life sailed
      by, and hold their breath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io opened her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you select that thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you mark it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I mark it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I&rsquo;m not responsible for the sage-blossom between
      the pages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the sage! That&rsquo;s for wisdom,&rdquo; she paraphrased
      lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Rossetti so wise a preceptor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often that he preaches. When he does, as in that
      sonnet&mdash;well, the inspiration may be a little heavy, but he does have
      something to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s the more evident that you marked it for some
      special reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What supernatural insight,&rdquo; she mocked. &ldquo;Can you read
      your name between the lines?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you want me to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to ask what it is that Mr. Rossetti wants you to do. I
      didn&rsquo;t write the sonnet, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t fashion the arrow, but you aimed it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a good marksman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean that I&rsquo;m wasting my time here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not!&rdquo; she gibed. &ldquo;Forming a link of
      transcontinental traffic. Helping to put a girdle &lsquo;round the earth
      in eighty days&mdash;or is it forty now?&mdash;enlightening the traveling
      public about the three-twenty-four train; dispensing time-tables and other
      precious mediums of education&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy here,&rdquo; he said doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be, always?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face darkened with doubt. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo; he
      argued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got everything I need. Some day I thought I
      might write.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; The question came sharp and quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked vaguely around the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Ban!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not this. You&rsquo;ve got to
      know something besides cactuses and owls to write, these days. You&rsquo;ve
      got to know men. And women,&rdquo; she added, in a curious tone, with a
      suspicion of effort, even of jealousy in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never cared much for people,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an acquired taste, I suppose for some of us. There&rsquo;s
      something else.&rdquo; She came slowly to a sitting posture and fixed her
      questioning, baffling eyes on his. &ldquo;Ban, don&rsquo;t you want to
      make a success in life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he did not answer. When he spoke, it was with apparent
      irrelevance to what she had said. &ldquo;Once I went to a revival. A
      reformed tough was running it. About every three minutes he&rsquo;d thrust
      out his hands and grab at the air and say, &lsquo;Oh, brothers; don&rsquo;t
      you yearn for Jesus?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo; questioned Io, surprised and
      impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that, somehow, the way you said &lsquo;success in life&rsquo;
      made me think of him and his &lsquo;yearn for Jesus.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Errol Banneker,&rdquo; said Io, amused in spite of her annoyance,
      &ldquo;you are possessed of a familiar devil who betrays other people&rsquo;s
      inner thoughts to you. Success <i>is</i> a species of religion to me, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are making converts, like all true enthusiasts. Tell, tell
      me. What kind of success?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, power. Money. Position. Being somebody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m somebody here all right. I&rsquo;m the station-agent of
      the Atkinson and St. Philip Railroad Company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re trying to provoke me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But to get success you&rsquo;ve got to want it, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; he asked more earnestly. &ldquo;To want it with all your
      strength.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Every man ought to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      kind of virtue in staying put, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a return for your sonnet,&rdquo; he pursued,
      and repeated from memory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is Wisdom? What of man&rsquo;s endeavor Or God&rsquo;s
      high grace, so lovely and so great? To stand from fear set free, to
      breathe and wait; To hold a hand uplifted over Hate. And shall not
      Loveliness be loved forever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it. It&rsquo;s beautiful. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gilbert Murray&rsquo;s translation of &lsquo;The Bacchae.&rsquo; My
      legal mentors had a lapse of dry-as-dustness and sent it to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      murmured the girl. &ldquo;That is what I&rsquo;ve been doing here. How
      good it is! But not for you,&rdquo; she added, her tone changing from
      dreamy to practical. &ldquo;Ban, I suspect there&rsquo;s too much poetry
      in your cosmos.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very probably. Poetry isn&rsquo;t success, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face grew eager. &ldquo;It might be. The very highest. But you&rsquo;ve
      got to make yourself known and felt among people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could? And how does one get that kind of desire?&rdquo;
      he asked lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? I&rsquo;ve known men to do it for love; and I&rsquo;ve known
      them to do it for hate; and I&rsquo;ve known them to do it for money. Yes;
      and there&rsquo;s another cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restlessness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ambition with its nerves gone bad, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know what it is some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it contagious?&rdquo; he asked solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I haven&rsquo;t it. Not now. I&rsquo;d love
      to stay on and on and just &lsquo;breathe and wait,&rsquo; if the gods
      were good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dream that the gods are good,&rsquo;&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;The last
      thing they ever think of being according to my reading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She capped his line;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We twain, once well in sunder, What will the mad gods do&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      she began; then broke off, jumping to her feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking
      sheer nonsense!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Take me for a walk in the woods.
      The desert glares to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be back by twelve,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Excuse
      me just a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared into the portable house. When he rejoined her, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you go in there for? To get your revolver?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve carried one since the day you told me to. Not that I&rsquo;ve
      met a soul that looked dangerous, nor that I&rsquo;d know how to shoot or
      when, if I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sight of it would be taken as evidence that you knew how to use
      it,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, as they walked, she had many questions to put about the tree
      and bird life surrounding them. In the midst of it he asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever get restless?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, here. I&rsquo;m getting rested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at home I suppose you&rsquo;re too busy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being busy is no preventive. Somebody has said that St. Vitus is
      the patron saint of New York society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must take almost all the time those people have to keep up with
      the theaters and with the best in poetry and what&rsquo;s being done and
      thought, and the new books and all that,&rdquo; he surmised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; what was that about poetry and books?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls like you&mdash;society girls, I mean&mdash;read everything
      there is, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you get that extraordinary idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, from knowing you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, innocent Ban! If you were to try and talk books and
      poetry, Shakespeare and the musical glasses,&rsquo; to the average
      society girl, as you call her, what do you suppose would happen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose I&rsquo;d give myself away as an ignoramus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven save you for a woolly lambkin! The girl would flee,
      shrieking, and issue a warning against you as a high-brow, a prig, and a
      hopeless bore. They don&rsquo;t read books, except a few chocolate-cream
      novels. They haven&rsquo;t the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a freak! I get away with it because I&rsquo;m
      passably good-looking and know how to dress, and do what I please by the
      divine right of&mdash;well, of just doing it. But, even so, a lot of the
      men are rather afraid of me in their hearts. They suspect the
      bluestocking. Let &rsquo;em suspect! The market is plenty good enough,&rdquo;
      declared Io flippantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you just took up books as a sort of freak; a side issue?&rdquo;
      The disappointment in his face was almost ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A quiet gravity altered her expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you about me, if you want to hear. My mother was the daughter of a
      famous classical scholar, who was opposed to her marriage because Father
      has always been a man of affairs. From the first, Mother brought me up to
      love books and music and pictures. She died when I was twelve, and poor
      Father, who worshiped her, wanted to carry out her plans for me, though he
      had no special sympathy with them. To make things worse for him, nobody
      but Mother ever had any control over me; I was spoiled and self-willed and
      precocious, and I thought the world owed me a good time. Dad&rsquo;s
      business judgment of human nature saved the situation, he thoroughly
      understood one thing about me, that I&rsquo;d keep a bargain if I made it.
      So we fixed up our little contract; I was to go through college and do my
      best, and after I graduated, I was to have a free hand and an income of my
      own, a nice one. I did the college trick. I did it well. I was third in my
      class, and there wasn&rsquo;t a thing in literature or languages that they
      could stop me from getting. At eighteen they turned me loose on the world,
      and here I am, tired of it, but still loving it. That&rsquo;s all of me.
      Aren&rsquo;t I a good little autobiographer. Every lady her own Boswell!
      What are you listening to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a horse coming along the old trail,&rdquo; said
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Some one following us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. A moment later the figure of a mounted man loomed
      through the brush. He was young, strong-built, and not ill-looking.
      &ldquo;Howdy, Ban,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker returned the greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whee-ew!&rdquo; shrilled the other, wiping his brow. &ldquo;This
      sure does fetch the licker outen a man&rsquo;s hide. Hell of a wet night
      at the Sick Coyote last night. Why wasn&rsquo;t you over?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy,&rdquo; replied Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his tone made the other raise himself from his weary droop.
      He sighted Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see there
      was ladies present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visitin&rsquo; hereabouts?&rdquo; inquired the man, eyeing her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, if I might be bold to ask?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got any questions to ask, ask them of me, Fred,&rdquo;
      directed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there was nothing truculent in his manner, it left no doubt as to
      his readiness and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred looked both sullen and crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only,
      inquiries was bein&rsquo; made by a gent from a Angelica City noospaper
      last week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody else meant,&rdquo; asserted Banneker. &ldquo;You keep that
      in mind, will you? And it isn&rsquo;t necessary that you should mention
      this lady at all. Savvy, Fred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other grunted, touched his sombrero to Io and rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has a reporter been here inquiring after me?&rdquo; asked Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after you. It was some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the newspapers tracked me here, I&rsquo;d have to leave at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t. At least, it isn&rsquo;t likely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d get me out some way, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Ban?&rdquo;
      she said trustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban; that Fred person seemed afraid of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got nothing to be afraid of unless he talks too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had him &lsquo;bluffed.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure you had. Ban,
      did you ever kill a man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or shoot one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, I believe, from the way he looked at you, that you&rsquo;ve
      got a reputation as a &lsquo;bad man&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have. But it&rsquo;s no fault of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll laugh if I tell you. They say I&rsquo;ve got a &lsquo;killer&rsquo;s&rsquo;
      eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl examined his face with grave consideration. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      got nice eyes,&rdquo; was her verdict. &ldquo;That deep brown is almost
      wasted on a man; some girl ought to have it. I used to hear a&mdash;a
      person, who made a deep impression on me at the time, insist that there
      was always a flaw in the character of a person with large, soft brown
      eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a flaw in every character?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature being imperfect, there must be. What is yours;
      suppressed murderousness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. My reputation is unearned, though useful. Just before I
      came here, a young chap showed up from nowhere and loafed around
      Manzanita. He was a pretty kind of lad, and one night in the Sick Coyote
      some of the old-timers tried to put something over on him. When the smoke
      cleared away, there was one dead and six others shot up, and Little
      Brownie was out on the desert, riding for the next place, awfully sore
      over a hole in his new sombrero. He was a two-gun man from down near the
      border. Well, when I arrived in town, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why
      every one looked so queerly at my eyes, until Mindle, the mail-driver,
      told me they were exactly like the hair-trigger boy&rsquo;s. Cheap and
      easy way to get a reputation, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have something back of it,&rdquo; insisted the girl.
      &ldquo;Are you a good shot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing fancy; there are twenty better in town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you pin some faith to your &lsquo;gun,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
      pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over his shoulder to right and left. Io jumped forward with a
      startled cry. So swift and secret had been his motion that she hardly saw
      the weapon before&mdash;PLACK&mdash;PLACK&mdash;PLACK&mdash;the three
      shots had sounded. The smoke drifted around him in a little circle, for
      the first two shots had been over his shoulder and the third as he
      whirled. Walking back, he carefully examined the trunks of three trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have only barked that fellow, if he&rsquo;d been a man,&rdquo;
      he observed, shaking his head at the second mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frightened me,&rdquo; complained Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I thought you wanted to see a little gun-play. Out
      here it isn&rsquo;t how straight you can shoot at a bull&rsquo;s-eye, but
      how quick you can plant your bullets, and usually in a mark that isn&rsquo;t
      obliging enough to be dead in line. So I practice occasionally, just in
      case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting. But I&rsquo;ve got luncheon to cook,&rdquo; said
      Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned through the desert. As he opened the door of the shack for
      her, Banneker, reverting to her autobiographical sketch, remarked
      thoughtfully and without preliminary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known there couldn&rsquo;t be any one else like you.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although the vehicle of his professional activities had for some years
      been a small and stertorous automobile locally known as &ldquo;Puffy Pete,&rdquo;
      Mr. James Mindle always referred to his process of postal transfer from
      the station to the town as &ldquo;teamin&rsquo; over the mail.&rdquo; He
      was a frail, grinny man from the prairie country, much given to romantic
      imaginings and an inordinate admiration for Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having watched from the seat of his chariot the brief but ceremonial entry
      of Number Three, which, on regular schedule, roared through Manzanita at
      top speed, he descended, captured the mail-bag and, as the
      transcontinental pulled out, accosted the station-agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d she stop for, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Special orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; about havin&rsquo; a ravin&rsquo;
      may-ni-ac aboard, did theh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, was you ever in the State of Ohio?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are Ohio folks liable to be loony?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than others, I reckon, Jimmy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty enthoosiastic about themselves, though, ain&rsquo;t theh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a nice country there, Jimmy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one on Number Three sure thought so. Hadn&rsquo;t
      scarcely come to a stop when off he jumps and waves his fins and gives
      three cheers for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ohio. I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you. He ramps across the track yippin&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Ohio! Ohio! Ohio!&rsquo; whoopity-yoop. He come right at me and I
      says, &lsquo;Watch yehself, Buddy. You&rsquo;ll git left.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to that?&rdquo; asked Banneker indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never looked at me no more than a doodle-bug. Just yelled &lsquo;Ohio!&rsquo;
      again. So I come back at him with &lsquo;Missourah.&rsquo; He grabs me by
      the shoulder and points to your shack. &lsquo;Who owns that little shed?&rsquo;
      says he, very excited. &lsquo;My friend, Mr. Banneker,&rsquo; says I,
      polite as always to strangers. &lsquo;But I own that shoulder you&rsquo;re
      leanin&rsquo; on, and I&rsquo;m about to take it away with me when I go,&rsquo;
      I says. He leaned off and says, &lsquo;Where did that young lady come from
      that was standin&rsquo; in the doorway a minute ago?&rsquo; &lsquo;Young
      lady,&rsquo; Ban. Do you get that? So I says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,
      Bud. When I get &rsquo;em, it&rsquo;s usually snakes and bugs and
      such-like rep-tyles. Besides,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;your train is about to
      forgit that you got off it,&rsquo; I says. With that he gives another
      screech that don&rsquo;t even mean as much as Ohio and tails onto the back
      platform just in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Ban, after frowning consideration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see any lady around the shack, did you, Jimmy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; replied the little man indignantly.
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had anything like that since I took the mail-teamin&rsquo;
      contract.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good time do you think Puffy Pete could make across-desert in
      case I should want it?&rdquo; inquired the agent after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mail-man contemplated his &ldquo;team,&rdquo; bubbling and panting a
      vaporous breath over the platform. &ldquo;Pete ain&rsquo;t none too fond
      of sand,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;But if you want to <i>git</i>
      anywhere, him and me&rsquo;ll git you there. You know that, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker nodded comradely and the post chugged away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the shack Io had set out the luncheon-things. To Banneker&rsquo;s
      eyes she appeared quite unruffled, despite the encounter which he had
      surmised from Jimmy&rsquo;s sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some flowers for the table, Ban,&rdquo; she directed.
      &ldquo;I want it to look festive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in particular?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m afraid we won&rsquo;t have many more luncheons
      together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no comment, but went out and returned with the flowers. Meantime
      Io had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had an unpleasant surprise, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up quickly. &ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Mindle, the mail transfer man, did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, that was Aleck Babson. &lsquo;Babbling Babson,&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
      called at the clubs. He&rsquo;s the most inveterate gossip in New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way from New York,&rdquo; pointed out Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he has a long tongue. Besides, he&rsquo;ll see the
      Westerleys and my other friends in Paradiso, and babble to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he does?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have people chasing here after me or pestering me
      with letters,&rdquo; she said passionately. &ldquo;Yet I don&rsquo;t want
      to go away. I want to get more rested, Ban, and forget a lot of things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. Comfort and comprehension were in his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be as companionable as a dog,&rdquo; said Io softly.
      &ldquo;Where did you get your tact, I wonder? Well, I shan&rsquo;t go till
      I must.... Lemonade, Ban! I brought over the lemons myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They lunched a little soberly and thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wanted it to be festive to-day,&rdquo; said Io wistfully,
      speaking out her thoughts as usual. &ldquo;Ban, does Miss Camilla smoke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if she does, you&rsquo;ll think it all right. And I want a
      cigarette now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s all right, Butterfly,&rdquo;
      returned her companion fetching a box from a shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold the thought!&rdquo; cried Io gayly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      creed for you! &lsquo;Whatever is, is right,&rsquo; provided that it&rsquo;s
      Io who does it. Always judge me by that standard, Ban, won&rsquo;t you?...
      Where in the name of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s ghost did you get these
      cigarettes? &lsquo;Mellorosa&rsquo; ... Ban, is this a Sears-Roebuck
      stock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It came from town. Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite curious and interesting. Never mind, my dear; I
      won&rsquo;t tease you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that Io&rsquo;s &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; was the most casual
      utterance imaginable, it brought a quick flush to Banneker&rsquo;s face.
      Chattering carelessly, she washed up the few dishes, put them away in the
      brackets, and then, smoking another of the despised Mellorosas, wandered
      to the book-shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read me something out of your favorite book, Ban.... No; this one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him the thick mail-order catalogue. With a gravity equal to her
      own he took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the spirit of Sears-Roebuck decide. Open at random and expound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust a finger between the leaves and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Special, Fortified Black Fiber Trunk for Hard Travel. Made of
      Three-Ply Ven&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to have my trunks again!&rdquo; sighed the girl. &ldquo;Turn to
      something else. I don&rsquo;t like that. It reminds me of travel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Obedient, Banneker made another essay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clay County Clay Target Traps. Easily Adjusted to the Elevation&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she broke in again. &ldquo;That reminds me that
      Dad wrote me to look up his pet shot-gun before his return. I don&rsquo;t
      like that either. Try again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the explorer plunged deep into the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How to Make Home Home-like. An Invaluable Counselor for the Woman
      of the Household&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io snatched the book from the reader&rsquo;s hand and tossed it into a
      corner. &ldquo;Sears-Roebuck are very tactless,&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;Everything they have to offer reminds one of home. What do you
      think of home, Ban? Home, as an abstract proposition. Home as the what-d&rsquo;you-call-&rsquo;em
      of the nation; the palladium&mdash;no, the bulwark? Home as viewed by the
      homing pigeon? Home, Sweet Home, as sung by&mdash;Would you answer, Ban,
      if I stopped gibbering and gave you the chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much opportunity to judge about home, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She darted out a quick little hand and touched his sleeve. The raillery
      had faded from her face. &ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t. Not very tactful of
      me, was it! Will you throw me into the corner with Mr. Sears and Mr.
      Roebuck, Ban? I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be. One gets used to being an air-plant without
      roots.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you wouldn&rsquo;t have fitted out this shack,&rdquo; she
      pointed out shrewdly, &ldquo;unless you had the instincts of home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough. Fortunately it&rsquo;s the kind of home I
      can take along when they transfer me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io went to the door and looked afar on the radiant splendor of the desert,
      and, nearer, into the cool peace of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t take all this,&rdquo; she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t take this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you miss it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shadow fell upon his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d miss something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know what it is&mdash;that no other place has ever given me. Why do you
      talk as if I were going away from it? I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; you are,&rdquo; she laughed softly. &ldquo;It is so
      written. I&rsquo;m a seeress.&rdquo; She turned from the door and threw
      herself into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will take me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something inside you. Something unawakened. &lsquo;Something lost
      beyond the ranges.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll know, and you&rsquo;ll obey it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ever come back, O seeress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the question her eyes grew dreamy and distant. Her voice when she spoke
      sank to a low-pitched monotone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll come back. Sometime.... So shall I ... not for
      years ... but&mdash;&rdquo; She jumped to her feet. &ldquo;What kind of
      rubbish am I talking?&rdquo; she cried with forced merriment. &ldquo;Is
      your tobacco drugged with hasheesh, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pull of the desert,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s caught you sooner than most. You&rsquo;re more
      responsive, I suppose; more sens&mdash;Why, Butterfly! You&rsquo;re
      shaking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Scotchman would say that I was &lsquo;fey.&rsquo; Ban, do you
      think it means that I&rsquo;m coming back here to die?&rdquo; She laughed
      again. &ldquo;If I were fated to die here, I expect that I missed my good
      chance in the smash-up. Fortunately I&rsquo;m not superstitious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be worse places,&rdquo; said he slowly. &ldquo;It is
      the place that would call me back if ever I got down and out.&rdquo; He
      pointed through the window to the distant, glowing purity of the mountain
      peak. &ldquo;One could tell one&rsquo;s troubles to that tranquil old god.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he listen to mine, I wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try him before you go. You can leave them all here and I&rsquo;ll
      watch over them for you to see that they don&rsquo;t get loose and bother
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolution! If it were only as easy as that! This <i>is</i> a
      haunted place.... Why should I be here at all? <i>Why</i> didn&rsquo;t I
      go when I should? Why a thousand things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any such thing? Why can&rsquo;t I sleep at night yet, as I
      ought? Why do I still feel hunted? What&rsquo;s happening to me, Ban? What&rsquo;s
      getting ready to happen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. That&rsquo;s nerves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll try not to think of it. But at night&mdash;Ban,
      suppose I should come over in the middle of the night when I can&rsquo;t
      sleep, and call outside your window?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d come down, of course. But you&rsquo;d have to be careful
      about rattlers,&rdquo; answered the practical Ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, Camilla, would intercept me, anyway. I don&rsquo;t
      think she sleeps too well, herself. Do you know what she&rsquo;s doing out
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came for her health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I asked you, my dear. Do you know what she&rsquo;s
      doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She never told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting. Aren&rsquo;t you curious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she wanted me to know, she&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indubitably correct, and quite praiseworthy,&rdquo; mocked the
      girl. &ldquo;Never mind; you know how to be staunch to your friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this country a man who doesn&rsquo;t is reckoned a yellow dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in any decent country. So take that with you when you go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; he asserted with an obstinate set to
      his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; she taunted. &ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t let me
      send you books?&rdquo; she questioned after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; she prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; he amended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an uncouth
      sort of person, but I meant the &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you did. And uncouthness is the last thing in the world
      you could be accused of. That&rsquo;s the wonder of it.... No; I don&rsquo;t
      suppose it really is. It&rsquo;s birth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s anything, it&rsquo;s training. My father was a
      stickler for forms, in spite of being a sort of hobo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, forms make the game, very largely. You won&rsquo;t find them
      essentially different when you go out into the&mdash;I forgot again. That
      kind of prophecy annoys you, doesn&rsquo;t it? There is one book I&rsquo;m
      going to send you, though, which you can&rsquo;t refuse. Nobody can refuse
      it. It isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer surprised him. &ldquo;The Bible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you religious? Of course, a butterfly should be, shouldn&rsquo;t
      she? should believe in the release of the soul from its chrysalis&mdash;the
      butterfly&rsquo;s immortality. Yet I wouldn&rsquo;t have suspected you of
      a leaning in that direction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, religion!&rdquo; Her tone set aside the subject as
      insusceptible of sufficient or satisfactory answer. &ldquo;I go through
      the forms,&rdquo; she added, a little disdainfully. &ldquo;As to what I
      believe and do&mdash;which is what one&rsquo;s own religion is&mdash;why,
      I assume that if the game is worth playing at all, there must be a Judge
      and Maker of the Rules. As far as I understand them, I follow them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a sort of religious feeling for success, though, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; he reminded her slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Just human, common sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your creed as you&rsquo;ve just given it, the rules of the game
      and that; that&rsquo;s precisely the Bible formula, I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she caught him up. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
      a Bible in the place, so far as I&rsquo;ve noticed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably. But I can&rsquo;t, somehow, adjust myself to that advice
      as coming from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m getting at. It
      isn&rsquo;t religious advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literary, purely. You&rsquo;re going to write, some day. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      look doubtful! That&rsquo;s foreordained. It doesn&rsquo;t take a seeress
      to prophesy that. And the Bible is the one book that a writer ought to
      read every day. Isaiah, Psalms, Proverbs. Pretty much all the Old
      Testament, and a lot of the New. It has grown into our intellectual life
      until its phrases and catchwords are full of overtones and sub-meanings.
      You&rsquo;ve got to have it in your business; your coming business, I
      mean. I know what I&rsquo;m talking about, Mr. Errol Banneker&mdash;<i>moi
      qui parle</i>. They offered me an instructorship in Literature when I
      graduated. I even threatened to take it, just for a joke on Dad. <i>Now</i>,
      will you be good and accept my fully explained and diagrammed Bible
      without fearing that I have designs on your soul?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you please go back to your work at once, and by and by
      take me home and stay to supper? Miss Van Arsdale told me to ask you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll be glad to. What will you do between now and
      four o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prowl in your library and unearth more of your secrets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome if you can find any. I don&rsquo;t deal in
      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Banneker, released from his duties until evening train time, rejoined
      her, and they were riding along the forest trail, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve started me to theorizing about myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it aloud,&rdquo; she invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; all my boyhood I led a wandering life, as you know. We were
      never anywhere as much as a month at a time. In a way, I liked the change
      and adventure. In another way, I got dead sick of it. Don&rsquo;t you
      suppose that my readiness to settle down and vegetate is the reaction from
      that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds reasonable enough. You might put it more simply by saying
      that you were tired. But by now you ought to be rested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I ought to be stirring myself so as to get tired again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stir, you&rsquo;ll rust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rust is a painless death for useless mechanism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shot an impatient side-glance at him. &ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re a
      hundred years old,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or that&rsquo;s sheer pose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is a sort of pose. If so, it&rsquo;s a self-protective
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I asked you to come to New York?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Intrepid though she was, her soul quaked a little at her own words,
      foreseeing those mail-order-cut clothes and the resolute butterflyness of
      the tie greeting her on Fifth Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell tickets at the Grand Central Station, of course!&rdquo; she
      shot back at him. &ldquo;Ban, you <i>are</i> aggravating! &lsquo;What to
      do?&rsquo; Father would find you some sort of place while you were fitting
      in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No. I wouldn&rsquo;t take a job from you any more than I&rsquo;d take
      anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carry principles to the length of absurdity. Come and get your
      own job, then. You&rsquo;re not timid, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly. I&rsquo;m just contented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that provocation her femininity flared. &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; she cried
      with exasperation and appeal enchantingly mingled, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you
      going to miss me at all when I go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying not to think of that,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, think of it,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she
      contradicted herself passionately. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.... I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter
      with me to-day, Ban. Perhaps I <i>am</i> fey.&rdquo; She smiled to him
      slantwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the air,&rdquo; he answered judicially. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      another storm brewing somewhere or I&rsquo;m no guesser. More trouble for
      the schedule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;<i>Be</i> the
      Atkinson and St. Philip station-agent again. Let&rsquo;s talk about
      trains. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s so reliable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it on this line,&rdquo; he answered, adopting her light
      tone. &ldquo;Particularly if we have more rain. You may become a permanent
      resident yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some rods short of the Van Arsdale cabin the trail took a sharp turn
      amidst the brush. Halfway on the curve Io caught at Banneker&rsquo;s near
      rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notes of a piano sounded faintly clear in the stillness. As the
      harmonies dissolved and merged, a voice rose above them, resonant and
      glorious, rose and sank and pleaded and laughed and loved, while the two
      young listeners leaned unconsciously toward each other in their saddles.
      Silence fell again. The very forest life itself seemed hushed in a
      listening trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; whispered Banneker. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camilla Van Arsdale, of course. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she was musical. I didn&rsquo;t know she had a voice like
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years ago New York was wild over it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! She&rsquo;s beginning again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the sweep of the chords was followed by the superb voice while
      the two wayfarers and all the world around them waited, breathless and
      enchained. At the end, Banneker said dreamily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard anything like that before. It says
      everything that can&rsquo;t be said in words alone, doesn&rsquo;t it? It
      makes me think of something&mdash;What is it?&rdquo; He groped for a
      moment, then repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A passionate ballad, gallant and gay, Singing afar in the
      springtime of life, Singing of youth and of love And of honor that cannot
      die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io drew a deep, tremulous breath. &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s like that. What a
      voice! And what an art to be buried out here! It&rsquo;s one of her own
      songs, I think. Probably an unpublished one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her own? Does she write music?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is Royce Melvin, the composer. Does that mean anything to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day it will. They say that he&mdash;every one thinks it&rsquo;s
      a he&mdash;will take Massenet&rsquo;s place as a lyrical composer. I found
      her out by accidentally coming on the manuscript of a Melvin song that I
      knew. That&rsquo;s her secret that I spoke of. Do you mind my having told
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no. It&rsquo;ll never go any further. I wonder why she never
      told me. And why she keeps so shut off from the world here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; that&rsquo;s another secret, and one that I shan&rsquo;t tell
      you,&rdquo; returned Io gravely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the piano again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few indeterminate chords came to their ears. There followed a jangling
      disharmony. They waited, but there was nothing more. They rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lodge Banneker took the horses around while Io went in. Immediately
      her voice, with a note of alarm in it, summoned him. He found her bending
      over Miss Van Arsdale, who lay across the divan in the living-room with
      eyes closed, breathing jerkily. Her lips were blue and her hands looked
      shockingly lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry her into her room,&rdquo; directed Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker picked up the tall, strong-built form without effort and
      deposited it on the bed in the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open all the windows,&rdquo; commanded the girl. &ldquo;See if you
      can find me some ammonia or camphor. Quick! She looks as if she were
      dying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another Banneker tried the bottles on the dresser. &ldquo;Here
      it is. Ammonia,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his eagerness he knocked a silver-mounted photograph to the floor. He
      thrust the drug into the girl&rsquo;s hand and watched her helplessly as
      she worked over the limp figure on the bed. Mechanically he picked up the
      fallen picture to replace it. There looked out at him the face of a man of
      early middle age, a face of manifest intellectual power, high-boned,
      long-lined, and of the austere, almost ascetic beauty which the Florentine
      coins have preserved for us in clear fidelity. Across the bottom was
      written in a peculiarly rhythmic script, the legend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toujours à toi. W.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming back,&rdquo; said Io&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;No.
      Don&rsquo;t come nearer. You&rsquo;ll shut off the air. Find me a fan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran to the outer room and came back with a palm-leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants something,&rdquo; said Io in an agonized half-voice.
      &ldquo;She wants it so badly. What is it? Help me, Ban! She can&rsquo;t
      speak. Look at her eyes&mdash;so imploring. Is it medicine?... No! Ban,
      can&rsquo;t you help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker took the silver-framed portrait and placed it in the flaccid
      hand. The fingers closed over it. The filmiest wraith of a smile played
      about the blue lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Io came out to Banneker waiting fearfully in the big room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t have a doctor. I&rsquo;ve given her the strychnia
      and she insists she&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I ought to go for the doctor, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t see him. She&rsquo;s very strong-willed.... That&rsquo;s
      a wonderful woman, Ban.&rdquo; Io&rsquo;s voice shook a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know about the picture?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it on the dresser. And when I saw her eyes, I guessed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s only one thing a woman wants like <i>that</i>,
      when she&rsquo;s dying. You&rsquo;re rather a wonderful person, yourself,
      to have known. That&rsquo;s her other secret, Ban. The one I said I couldn&rsquo;t
      tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten it,&rdquo; replied Banneker gravely.
    </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Attendance upon the sick-room occupied Io&rsquo;s time for several days
      thereafter. Morning and afternoon Banneker rode over from the station to
      make anxious inquiry. The self-appointed nurse reported progress as rapid
      as could be expected, but was constantly kept on the alert because of the
      patient&rsquo;s rebellion against enforced idleness. Seizures of the same
      sort she had suffered before, it appeared, but none hitherto so severe.
      Nothing could be done, she told Io, beyond the administration of the
      medicine, for which she had full directions. One day an attack would
      finish it all; meantime, in spite of her power of self-repression, she
      chafed at the monotony of her imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late afternoon of the day after the collapse, while Io was heating
      water at the fireplace, she heard a drawer open in the sick-room and
      hurried back to find Miss Van Arsdale hanging to the dresser, her face
      gray-splotched and her fingers convulsively crushing a letter which she
      had taken from under lock. Alarmed and angry, the amateur nurse got her
      back to bed only half conscious, but still cherishing her trove. When, an
      hour later, she dared leave her charge, she heard the rustle of
      smoothed-out paper and remained outside long enough to allow for the
      reading. On her return there was no sign of the letter. Miss Van Arsdale,
      a faint and hopeful color in her cheeks, was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Banneker these were days of trial and tribulation. Added to the
      anxiety that he felt for his best friend was the uncertainty as to what he
      ought to do about the developments affecting her guest. For he had heard
      once more from Gardner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the cards,&rdquo; wrote the reporter, &ldquo;that I
      may be up to see you again. I&rsquo;m still working, on and off, on the
      tip that took me on that wild-goose chase. If I come again I won&rsquo;t
      quit without some of the wild goose&rsquo;s tail feathers, at least. There&rsquo;s
      a new tip locally; it leaked out from Paradise. [&ldquo;The Babbling
      Babson,&rdquo; interjected the reader mentally.] It looks as though the
      bird were still out your way. Though how she could be, and you not know
      it, gets me. It&rsquo;s even a bigger game than Stella Wrightington, if my
      information is O.K. Have you heard or seen anything lately of a Beautiful
      Stranger or anything like that around Manzanita?... I enclose clipping of
      your story. What do you think of yourself in print?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker thought quite highly of himself in print as he read the article,
      which he immediately did. The other matter could wait; not that it was
      less important; quite the contrary; but he proposed to mull it over
      carefully and with a quiet mind, if he could ever get his mind back to its
      peaceful current again: meantime it was good for him to think of something
      quite dissociated from the main problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      What writer has not felt the conscious red tingle in his cheeks at first
      sight of himself in the magnified personification of type? Here is
      something, once himself, now expanded far beyond individual limits, into
      the proportions of publicity, for all the world to measure and estimate
      and criticize. Ought it to have been done in just that way? Is there not
      too much &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the presentation? Would not the effect have
      been greater had the method been less personal? It seemed to Banneker that
      he himself stood forth in a stark nakedness of soul and thought, through
      those blatantly assertive words, shameless, challenging to public opinion,
      yet delightful to his own appreciation. On the whole it was good; better
      than he would have thought he could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had felt, in the writing of it, to be jerks and bumps were
      magically smoothed out in the finished product. At one point where the
      copy-reader&rsquo;s blue pencil had elided an adjective which the writer
      had deemed specially telling, he felt a sharp pang of disappointed
      resentment. Without that characterization the sentence seemed lifeless.
      Again, in another passage he wished that he had edited himself with more
      heed to the just word. Why had he designated the train as &ldquo;rumbling&rdquo;
      along the cut? Trains do not rumble between rock walls, he remembered;
      they move with a sustained and composite roar. And the finger-wringing
      malcontent who had vowed to &ldquo;soom&rdquo;; the editorial pencil had
      altered that to &ldquo;sue &rsquo;em,&rdquo; thereby robbing it of its
      special flavor. Perhaps this was in accordance with some occult rule of
      the trade. But it spoiled the paragraph for Banneker. Nevertheless he was
      thrilled and elate.... He wanted to show the article to Io. What would she
      think of it? She had read him accurately: it <i>was</i> in him to write.
      And she could help him, if only by&mdash;well, if only by being at
      hand.... But Gardner&rsquo;s letter! That meant that the pursuit was on
      again, more formidably this time. Gardner, the gadfly, stinging this
      modern Io out of her refuge of peace and safety!
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote and dispatched a message to the reporter in care of the Angelica
      City Herald:
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad to see you, but you are wasting your time. No such person could be
      here without my knowing it. Thanks for article.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was as near an untruth as Banneker cared to go. In his own mind he
      defended it on the ground that the projected visit would, in fact, be time
      wasted for the journalist since he, Banneker, intended fully that Gardner
      should not see Io. Deep would have been his disgust and self-derision
      could he have observed the effect of the message upon the cynical and
      informed journalist who, however, did not receive it until the second day
      after its transmission, as he had been away on another assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fish!&rdquo; was Gardner&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
      even say that she isn&rsquo;t there. He&rsquo;s got to lie better than
      that if he goes into the newspaper game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, the reporter had received a note from the cowman whom Ban and Io
      had encountered in the woods, modestly requesting five dollars in return
      for the warranted fact that a &ldquo;swell young lady&rdquo; had been seen
      in Banneker&rsquo;s company. Other journalistic matters were pressing,
      however; he concluded that the &ldquo;Manzanita Mystery,&rdquo; as he
      built it up headline-wise in his ready mind, could wait a day or two
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, through the mechanical course of his office, debated the
      situation. Should he tell Io of the message? To do so would only add to
      her anxieties, probably to no good purpose, for he did not believe that
      she would desert Miss Van Arsdale, ill and helpless, on any selfish
      consideration. Fidelity was one of the virtues with which he had
      unconsciously garlanded Io. Then, too, Gardner might not come anyway. If
      he did Banneker was innocently confident of his own ability to outwit the
      trained reporter and prevent his finding the object of his quest. A
      prospective and possible ally was forecast in the weather. Warning of
      another rainfall impending had come over the wire. As yet there was no
      sign visible from his far-horizoned home, except a filmy and changeful
      wreath of palest cloud with which Mount Carstairs was bedecked. Banneker
      decided for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale was much better when he rode over in the morning, but Io
      looked piteously worn and tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had no rest,&rdquo; he accused her, away from the sick
      woman&rsquo;s hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest enough of its kind, but not much sleep,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to have sleep,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Let
      me stay and look after her to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be of any use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t sleep anyway. This house is haunted by spirits of
      unrest,&rdquo; said the girl fretfully. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a
      blanket and go out on the desert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wake up to find a sidewinder crawling over you, and a tarantula
      nestling in your ear. Don&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; called the voice of Camilla Van Arsdale from the inner
      room, clear and firm as he had ever heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in. She stretched out a hand to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see
      you, Ban. Have I worried you? I shall be up and about again to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; protested Banneker, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get up to-morrow,&rdquo; repeated the other
      immutably. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd about it. I&rsquo;m not ill. It
      was only the sort of knock-down that I must expect from time to time.
      Within a day or two you&rsquo;ll see me riding over.... Ban, stand over
      there in that light.... What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Miss Camilla?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That necktie. It isn&rsquo;t in your usual style. Where did you get
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent to Angelica City for it. Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; he
      returned, trying for the nonchalant air, but not too successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as well as your spotty butterflies,&rdquo; answered the woman
      jealously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense, though. Don&rsquo;t mind me, Ban,&rdquo;
      she added with a wry smile. &ldquo;Plain colors are right for you. Browns,
      or blues, or reds, if they&rsquo;re not too bright. And you&rsquo;ve tied
      it very well. Did it take you long to do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Reddening and laughing, he admitted a prolonged and painful session before
      his glass. Miss Van Arsdale sighed. It was such a faint, abandoning breath
      of regret as might come from the breast of a mother when she sees her
      little son in his first pride of trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out and say good-night to Miss Welland,&rdquo; she ordered,
      &ldquo;and tell her to go to bed. I&rsquo;ve taken a sleeping powder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker obeyed. He rode home slowly and thoughtfully. His sleep was sound
      enough that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast-getting processes did not appeal to him when he awoke in the
      morning. He walked over, through the earliest light, to the hotel, where
      he made a meal of musty eggs, chemical-looking biscuits, and coffee of a
      rank hue and flavor, in an atmosphere of stale odors and flies,
      sickeningly different from the dainty ceremonials of Io&rsquo;s
      preparation. Rebuking himself for squeamishness, the station-agent
      returned to his office, caught an O.S. from the wire, took some general
      instructions, and went out to look at the weather. His glance never
      reached the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the foreground where he had swung the hammock under the alamo it
      checked and was held, absorbed. A blanketed figure lay motionless in the
      curve of the meshwork. One arm was thrown across the eyes, warding a
      strong beam which had forced its way through the lower foliage. He tiptoed
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io&rsquo;s breast was rising and falling gently in the hardly perceptible
      rhythm of her breathing. From the pale yellow surface of her dress, below
      the neck, protruded a strange, edged something, dun-colored, sharply
      defined and alien, which the man&rsquo;s surprised eyes failed to
      identify. Slowly the edge parted and flattened out, broadwise, displaying
      the marbled brilliance of the butterfly&rsquo;s inner wings, illumining
      the pale chastity of the sleeping figure as if with a quivering and
      evanescent jewel. Banneker, shaken and thrilled, closed his eyes. He felt
      as if a soul had opened its secret glories to him. When, commanding
      himself, he looked again, the living gem was gone. The girl slept evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conning the position of the sun and the contour of the sheltering tree,
      Banneker estimated that in a half-hour or less a flood of sunlight would
      pour in upon the slumberer&rsquo;s face to awaken her. Cautiously
      withdrawing, he let himself into the shack, lighted his oil stove, put on
      water to boil, set out the coffee and the stand. He felt different about
      breakfast-getting now. Having prepared the arrangements for his
      prospective guest, he returned and leaned against the alamo, filling his
      eyes with still delight of the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Youthful, untouched, fresh though the face was, in the revealing stillness
      of slumber, it suggested rather than embodied something indefinably
      ancient, a look as of far and dim inheritances, subtle, ironic,
      comprehending, and aloof; as if that delicate and strong beauty of hers
      derived intimately from the wellsprings of the race; as if womanhood,
      eternal triumphant, and elusive were visibly patterned there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, leaning against the slender tree-trunk, dreamed over her,
      happily and aimlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io opened her eyes to meet his. She stirred softly and smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you discovered me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She studied the sun a moment before replying. &ldquo;Several hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you walk over in the night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You told me not to, you know. I waited till the dawn. Don&rsquo;t
      scold me, Ban. I was dead for want of sleep and I couldn&rsquo;t get it in
      the lodge. It&rsquo;s haunted, I tell you, with unpeaceful spirits. So I
      remembered this hammock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to scold you. I&rsquo;m going to feed you. The
      coffee&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good!&rdquo; she cried, getting to her feet. &ldquo;Am I a
      sight? I feel frowsy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of buckets of water up in my room. Help
      yourself while I set out the breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen minutes she was down, freshened and joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take a bite and then run back to my patient,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;You can bring the blanket when you come. It&rsquo;s heavy
      for a three-mile tramp.... What are you looking thoughtful and sober
      about, Ban? Do you disapprove of my escapade?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a foolish question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be. And it&rsquo;s meant to make you smile. Why
      don&rsquo;t you? You <i>are</i> worried. &lsquo;Fess up. What&rsquo;s
      happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a letter from the reporter in Angelica City.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Did he send your article?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. But that isn&rsquo;t the point. He says he&rsquo;s coming
      up here again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know I&rsquo;m here? Did he mention my name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But he&rsquo;s had some information that probably points to
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ban told her. &ldquo;I think that will hold him off,&rdquo; he said
      hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s a very queer sort of reporter,&rdquo; returned Io
      scornfully out of her wider experience. &ldquo;No; he&rsquo;ll come. And
      if he&rsquo;s any good, he&rsquo;ll find me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can refuse to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it&rsquo;s the mere fact of my being here that will
      probably give him enough to go on and build up a loathsome article. How I
      hate newspapers!... Ban,&rdquo; she appealed wistfully, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
      you stop him from coming? Must I go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be ready to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until Miss Camilla is well again,&rdquo; she declared
      obstinately. &ldquo;But that will be in a day or two. Oh, well! What does
      it all matter! I&rsquo;ve not much to pack up, anyway. How are you going
      to get me out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on whether Gardner comes, and how he comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a darkening line above the southwestern horizon. &ldquo;If
      that is what it looks like, we may be in for another flood, though I&rsquo;ve
      never known two bad ones in a season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io beckoned quaintly to the far clouds. &ldquo;Hurry! Hurry!&rdquo; she
      summoned. &ldquo;You wrecked me once. Now save me from the Vandal.
      Good-bye, Ban. And thank you for the lodging and the breakfast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emergency demands held the agent at his station all that day and evening.
      Trainmen brought news of heavy rains beyond the mountains. In the morning
      he awoke to find his little world hushed in a murky light and with a
      tingling apprehension of suspense in the atmosphere. High, gray cloud
      shapes hurried across the zenith to a conference of the storm powers,
      gathering at the horizon. Weather-wise from long observation, Banneker
      guessed that the outbreak would come before evening, and that, unless the
      sullen threat of the sky was deceptive, Manzanita would be shut off from
      rail communication within twelve hours thereafter. Having two hours&rsquo;
      release at noon, he rode over to the lodge in the forest to return Io&rsquo;s
      blanket. He found the girl pensive, and Miss Van Arsdale apparently
      recovered to the status of her own normal and vigorous self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been telling Io,&rdquo; said the older woman, &ldquo;that,
      since the rumor is out of her being here, she will almost certainly be
      found by the reporter. Too many people in the village know that I have a
      guest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my marketing. Probably from Pedro.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely from the patron of the Sick Coyote that you and I met
      on our walk,&rdquo; added the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the wise thing is for her to go,&rdquo; concluded Miss Van
      Arsdale. &ldquo;Unless she is willing to risk the publicity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Io. &ldquo;The wise thing is for me to go.&rdquo;
      She spoke in a curious tone, not looking at Banneker, not looking at
      anything outward and visible; her vision seemed somberly introverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, though,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked both women. He answered Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called for a storm. You&rsquo;re going to get it. A big one. I
      could send you out on Number Eight, but that&rsquo;s a way-train and there&rsquo;s
      no telling where it would land you or when you&rsquo;d get through.
      Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe Gardner is coming. I&rsquo;d have heard
      from him by now. Listen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow pat-pat-pat of great raindrops ticked like a started clock on the
      roof. It ceased, and far overhead the great, quiet voice of the wind said,
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo;, bidding the world
      lie still and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he does come?&rdquo; asked Miss Van Arsdale
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get word to you and get her out some way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm burst on Banneker, homebound, just as he emerged from the
      woodland, in a wild, thrashing wind from the southwest and a downpour the
      most fiercely, relentlessly insistent that he had ever known. A cactus
      desert in the rare orgy of a rainstorm is a place of wonder. The
      monstrous, spiky forms trembled and writhed in ecstasy, heat-damned souls
      in their hour of respite, stretching out exultant arms to the bounteous
      sky. Tiny rivulets poured over the sand, which sucked them down with a
      thirsting, crisping whisper. A pair of wild doves, surprised and
      terrified, bolted close past the lone rider, so near that his mount shied
      and headed for the shelter of the trees again. A small snake, curving
      indecisively and with obvious bewilderment amidst the growth, paused to
      rattle a faint warning, half coiled in case the horse&rsquo;s step meant a
      new threat, then went on with a rather piteous air of not knowing where to
      find refuge against this cataclysm of the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lashing in the wind, a long tentacle of the giant ocatilla drew its
      cimeter-set thong across Ban&rsquo;s horse which incontinently bolted. The
      rider lifted up his voice and yelled in sheer, wild, defiant joy of the
      tumult. A lesser ocatilla thorn gashed his ear so that the blood mingled
      with the rain that poured down his face. A pod of the fishhook-barbed
      cholla drove its points through his trousers into the flesh of his knee
      and, detaching itself from the stem, as is the detestable habit of this
      vegetable blood-seeker, clung there like a live thing of prey, from barbs
      which must later be removed delicately and separately with the cold steel.
      Blindly homing, a jack-rabbit ran almost beneath the horse&rsquo;s hooves,
      causing him to shy again, this time into a bulky vizcaya, as big as a
      full-grown man, and inflicting upon Ban a new species of scarification. It
      did not matter. Nothing mattered. He rode on, knees tight, lines loose,
      elate, shouting, singing, acclaiming the storm which was setting its
      irrefragable limits to the world wherein he and Io would still live close,
      a few golden days longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he picked from the wire when he reached it confirmed his hopes. The
      track was threatened in a dozen places. Repair crews were gathering.
      Already the trains were staggering along, far behind their schedule. They
      would, of course, operate as far as possible, but no reliance was to be
      placed upon their movements until further notice. Through the night
      traffic continued, but with the coming of the morning and the settling
      down of a soft, seeping, unintermittent pour of gray rain, the situation
      had clarified. Nothing came through. Complete stoppage, east and west.
      Between Manzanita and Stanwood the track was out, and in the other
      direction Dry Bed Arroyo was threatening. Banneker reported progress to
      the lodge and got back, soaked and happy. Io was thoughtful and content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon the station-agent had a shock which jarred him quite
      out of his complacent security. Denny, the operator at Stanwood, wired,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      Party here anxious to get through to Manzanita quick. Could auto make
      upper desert?
    </p>
    <p>
      No (clicked Banneker in response). Describe party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came back confirming his suspicion:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thin, nice-spoken, wears goggles, smokes cork-tips. Arrived Five from
      Angelica held here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell impossible by any route (instructed Banneker). Wire result.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later came the reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      Won&rsquo;t try to-night. Probably horse to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a problem, indeed, fit to chill the untimely self-congratulations
      of Banneker. Should the reporter come in&mdash;and come he would if it
      were humanly possible, by Banneker&rsquo;s estimate of him&mdash;it would
      be by the only route which gave exit to the west. On the other side the
      flooded arroyo cut off escape. To try to take Io out through the forest,
      practically trackless, in that weather, or across the channeled desert,
      would be too grave a risk. To all intents and purposes they were marooned
      on an island with no reasonable chance of exit&mdash;except! To Banneker&rsquo;s
      feverishly searching mind reverted a local legend. Taking a chance on
      missing some emergency call, he hurried over to the village and
      interviewed, through the persuasive interpretation of sundry drinks, an
      aged and bearded wreck whose languid and chipped accents spoke of a life
      originally far alien to the habitudes of the Sick Coyote where he was
      fatalistically awaiting his final attack of delirium tremens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker returned from that interview with a map upon which had been
      scrawled a few words in shaky, scholarly writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s safe, mind you,&rdquo; had
      warned the shell of Lionel Streatham in his husky pipe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      only as a sporting offer that one would touch it. And the courses may have
      changed in seven years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Denny wired in the morning that the inquiring traveler had set out from
      Manzanita, unescorted, on horseback, adding the prediction that he would
      have a hell of a trip, even if he got through at all. Late that afternoon
      Gardner arrived at the station, soaked, hollow-eyed, stiff, exhausted, and
      cheerful. He shook hands with the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like yourself in print?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; answered Banneker. &ldquo;It read better than I
      expected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It always does, until you get old in the business. How would you
      like a New York job on the strength of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker stared. &ldquo;You mean that I could get on a paper just by
      writing that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so. Though I&rsquo;ve known poorer stuff land
      more experienced men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More experienced; that&rsquo;s the point, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve
      had none at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. A metropolitan paper prefers to take a man
      fresh and train him to its own ways. There&rsquo;s your advantage if you
      can show natural ability. And you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; muttered Banneker thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Miss Van Arsdale live?&rdquo; asked the reporter without
      the smallest change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see Miss Van Arsdale for?&rdquo; returned the
      other, his instantly defensive manner betraying him to the newspaper man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I do,&rdquo; smiled Gardner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Van Arsdale has been ill. She&rsquo;s a good deal of a
      recluse. She doesn&rsquo;t like to see people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does her visitor share that eccentricity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Banneker,&rdquo; said the reporter earnestly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      like to know why you&rsquo;re against me in this thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; fenced the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My search for Io Welland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Io Welland, and what are you after her for?&rdquo; asked
      Banneker steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apart from being the young lady that you&rsquo;ve been escorting
      around the local scenery,&rdquo; returned the imperturbable journalist,
      &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the most brilliant and interesting figure in the
      younger set of the Four Hundred. She&rsquo;s a newspaper beauty. She&rsquo;s
      copy. She&rsquo;s news. And when she gets into a railroad wreck and
      disappears from the world for weeks, and her supposed fiancé, the heir to
      a dukedom, makes an infernal ass of himself over it all and practically
      gives himself away to the papers, she&rsquo;s big news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if she hasn&rsquo;t done any of these things,&rdquo; retorted
      Banneker, drawing upon some of Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s wisdom, brought
      to bear on the case, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s libel, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly libel. But she isn&rsquo;t safe news until she&rsquo;s
      identified. You see, I&rsquo;m playing an open game with you. I&rsquo;m
      here to identify her, with half a dozen newspaper photos. Want to see
      &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested? Are you going to take me over to Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? It&rsquo;s no part of my business as an employee of
      the road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that, I&rsquo;ve got a letter from the Division
      Superintendent asking you to further my inquiry in any possible way. Here
      it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker took and read the letter. While not explicit, it was sufficiently
      direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s official, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Gardner mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is official,&rdquo; added Banneker calmly. &ldquo;The
      company can go to hell. Tell that to the D.S. with my compliments, will
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. I don&rsquo;t want to get you into trouble. I like
      you. But I&rsquo;ve got to land this story. If you won&rsquo;t take me to
      the place, I&rsquo;ll find some one in the village that will. You can&rsquo;t
      prevent my going there, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s voice had grown low and
      cold. A curious light shone in his eyes. There was an ugly flicker of
      smile on his set mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter rose from the chair into which he had wetly slumped. He
      walked over to face his opponent who was standing at his desk. Banneker,
      lithe, powerful, tense, was half again as large as the other; obviously
      more muscular, better-conditioned, more formidable in every way. But there
      is about a man, singly and selflessly intent upon his job in hand, an
      inner potency impossible to obstruct. Banneker recognized it; inwardly
      admitted, too, the unsoundness of the swift, protective rage rising
      within, himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose to make trouble for you or to have trouble
      with you,&rdquo; said the reporter evenly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to
      Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s unless I&rsquo;m shot on the way there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; returned the agent, mastering
      himself. &ldquo;I beg your pardon for threatening you. But you&rsquo;ll
      have to find your own way. Will you put up here for the night, again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Glad to, if it won&rsquo;t trouble you. See you later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. I&rsquo;m turning in early. I&rsquo;ll leave the shack
      unlocked for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner opened the outer door and was blown back into the station by an
      explosive gust of soaking wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On second thought,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
      try to go out there this evening. The young lady can&rsquo;t very well get
      away to-night, unless she has wings, and it&rsquo;s pretty damp for
      flying. Can I get dinner over at the village?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as it is. I&rsquo;ll go over with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the unclean little hotel they parted, Banneker going
      further to find Mindle the &ldquo;teamer,&rdquo; whom he could trust and
      with whom he held conference, brief and very private. They returned to the
      station together in the gathering darkness, got a hand car onto the track,
      and loaded it with a strange burden, after which Mindle disappeared into
      the storm with the car while Banneker wired to Stanwood an imperative call
      for a relief for next day even though the substitute should have to walk
      the twenty-odd miles. Thereafter he made, from the shack, a careful
      selection of food with special reference to economy of bulk, fastened it
      deftly beneath his poncho, saddled his horse, and set out for the Van
      Arsdale lodge. The night was pitch-black when he entered the area of the
      pines, now sonorous with the rush of the upper winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io saw the gleam of his flashlight and ran to the door to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be in fifteen minutes.&rdquo; She turned away, asking no
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress warmly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an all-night trip.
      By the way, can you swim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For hours at a time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale entered the room. &ldquo;Are you taking her away, Ban?
      Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Miradero, on the Southwestern and Sierra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s insanity,&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;Sixty
      miles, isn&rsquo;t it? And over trailless desert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of that. But we&rsquo;re not going across country. We&rsquo;re
      going by water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By water? Ban, you <i>are</i> out of your mind. Where is there any
      waterway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry Bed Arroyo. It&rsquo;s running bank-full. My boat is waiting
      there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be dangerous. Terribly dangerous. Io, you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said the girl quietly, &ldquo;if Ban says so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way out. And it isn&rsquo;t so dangerous if
      you&rsquo;re used to a boat. Old Streatham made it seven years ago in the
      big flood. Did it in a bark canoe on a hundred-dollar bet. The Arroyo
      takes you out to the Little Bowleg and that empties into the Rio Solano,
      and there you are! I&rsquo;ve got his map.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Map?&rdquo; cried Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;What use is a map when
      you can&rsquo;t see your hand before your face?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give this wind a chance,&rdquo; answered Banneker. &ldquo;Within
      two hours the clouds will have broken and we&rsquo;ll have moonlight to go
      by.... The Angelica Herald man is over at the hotel now,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take a suitcase?&rdquo; asked Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll strap it to your pony if you&rsquo;ll get it
      ready. Miss Camilla, what shall we do with the pony? Hitch him under the
      bridge?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re determined to take her, I&rsquo;ll ride over with
      you and bring him back. Io, think! Is it worth the risk? Let the reporter
      come. I can keep him away from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A brooding expression was in the girl&rsquo;s deep eyes as she turned
      them, not to the speaker, but to Banneker. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get away sooner or later. I&rsquo;d rather go
      this way. It&rsquo;s more&mdash;it&rsquo;s more of a pattern with all the
      rest; better than stupidly waving good-bye from the rear of a train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Che sará, sará</i>,&rdquo; returned Io lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      trust him to take care of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Ban went out to prepare the horses with the aid of Pedro, strictly
      enjoined to secrecy, the two women got Io&rsquo;s few things together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you,&rdquo; said the girl, looking up as she
      snapped the lock of her case. &ldquo;It simply isn&rsquo;t a case for
      thanking. You&rsquo;ve done too much for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman disregarded it. &ldquo;How much are you hurting Ban?&rdquo;
      she said, with musing eyes fixed on the dim and pure outline of the
      girlish face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Hurt him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he won&rsquo;t realize it until you&rsquo;ve gone. Then I&rsquo;m
      afraid to think what is coming to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid to think what is coming to me,&rdquo; replied
      the girl, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you!&rdquo; retorted her hostess, dismissing that consideration
      with contemptuous lightness. &ldquo;You have plenty of compensations,
      plenty of resources.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Up to now. What will he do when he wakes up to an empty
      world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write, won&rsquo;t he? And then the world won&rsquo;t be empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think it so. That is why I&rsquo;m sorry for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be sorry a little for me?&rdquo; pleaded the girl.
      &ldquo;Anyway, for the part of me that I&rsquo;m leaving here? Perhaps it&rsquo;s
      the very best of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, no! A pleasantly vivid dream
      of changed and restful things. That&rsquo;s all. Your waking will be only
      a sentimental and perfumed regret&mdash;a sachet-powder sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bitter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him hurt,&rdquo; protested the other. &ldquo;Why
      did you come here? What should a girl like you, feverish and
      sensation-loving and artificial, see in a boy like Ban to charm you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t you understand? It&rsquo;s just because my world
      has been too dressed up and painted and powdered that I feel the charm of&mdash;of&mdash;well,
      of ease of existence. He&rsquo;s as easy as an animal. There&rsquo;s
      something about him&mdash;you must have felt it&mdash;sort of impassioned
      sense of the gladness of life; when he has those accesses he&rsquo;s like
      a young god, or a faun. But he doesn&rsquo;t know his own power. At those
      times he might do anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little and her lids drooped over the luster of her dreaming
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want to tempt him out of this to a world where he would be
      a wretched misfit,&rdquo; accused the older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? No; I think I don&rsquo;t. I think I&rsquo;d rather hold him
      in my mind as he is here: a happy eremite; no, a restrained pagan. Oh, it&rsquo;s
      foolish to seek definitions for him. He isn&rsquo;t definable. He&rsquo;s
      Ban....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you get back into the world, what will you do, I wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t send for him, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what <i>will</i> you do, I wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; repeated Io somberly.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Silently they rode through the stir and thresh of the night, the two women
      and the man. For guidance along the woods trail they must trust to the
      finer sense of their horses whose heads they could not see in the
      closed-in murk. A desultory spray fell upon them as the wind wrenched at
      the boughs overhead, but the rain had ceased. Infinitely high, infinitely
      potent sounded the imminent tumult of the invisible Powers of the night,
      on whose sufferance they moved, tiny, obscure, and unharmed. It filled all
      the distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debouching upon the open desert, they found their range of vision slightly
      expanded. They could dimly perceive each other. The horses drew closer
      together. With his flash covered by his poncho, Banneker consulted a
      compass and altered their course, for he wished to give the station, to
      which Gardner might have returned, a wide berth. Io moved up abreast of
      him as he stood, studying the needle. Had he turned the light upward he
      would have seen that she was smiling. Whether he would have interpreted
      that smile, whether, indeed, she could have interpreted it herself, is
      doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they picked up the line of telegraph poles, well beyond the
      station, just the faintest suggestion of gaunt rigor against the troubled
      sky, and skirted them, moving more rapidly in the confidence of assured
      direction. A very gradual, diffused alleviation of the darkness began to
      be felt. The clouds were thinning. Something ahead of them hissed in a
      soft, full, insistent monosonance. Banneker threw up a shadowy arm. They
      dismounted on the crest of a tiny desert clifflet, now become the bank of
      a black current which nuzzled and nibbled into its flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io gazed intently at the flood which was to deliver her out of the hands
      of the Philistine. How far away the other bank of the newborn stream might
      be, she could only guess from the vague rush in her ears. The arroyo&rsquo;s
      water slipped ceaselessly, objectlessly away from beneath her strained
      vision, smooth, suave, even, effortless, like the process of some
      unhurried and mighty mechanism. Now and again a desert plant, uprooted
      from its arid home, eddied joyously past her, satiated for once of its
      lifelong thirst; and farther out she thought to have a glimpse of some
      dead and whitish animal. But these were minor blemishes on a great,
      lustrous ribbon of silken black, unrolled and re-rolled from darkness into
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beckoning us,&rdquo; said Io, leaning to Banneker, her
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must wait for more light,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you trust yourself to <i>that</i>?&rdquo; asked Camilla Van
      Arsdale, with a gesture of fear and repulsion toward the torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; returned Io. There was exaltation in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; cried the older woman. &ldquo;How
      do you know what may lie before you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the thrill of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be death around the first curve. It&rsquo;s so unknown;
      so secret and lawless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, and I&rsquo;m lawless!&rdquo; cried Io. &ldquo;I could defy the
      gods on a night like this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung her arms aloft, in a movement of sweet, wild abandon, and, as if
      in response to an incantation, the sky was reft asunder and the moon
      rushed forth, free for the moment of the clutching clouds, fugitive,
      headlong, a shining Maenad of the heavens, surrounded by the rush and
      whirl that had whelmed earth and its waters and was hurrying them to an
      unknown, mad destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we can see our way,&rdquo; said Banneker, the practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He studied the few rods of sleek, foamless water between him and the
      farther bank, and, going to the steel boat which Mindle had brought to the
      place on the hand car, took brief inventory of its small cargo. Satisfied,
      he turned to load in Io&rsquo;s few belongings. He shipped the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let her go stem-first,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;so
      that I can see what we&rsquo;re coming to and hold her if there&rsquo;s
      trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you see?&rdquo; objected Miss Van Arsdale, directing a
      troubled look at the breaking sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll run her ashore until we can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed Io the flashlight and the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want me in the bow seat if we&rsquo;re traveling
      reversed,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented. &ldquo;Good sailorwoman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; protested Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a mad business. Ban, you oughtn&rsquo;t to take her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to talk of that,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; questioned Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed the stern of the boat into the stream, and the current laid it
      neatly and powerfully flat to the sheer bank. Io kissed Camilla Van
      Arsdale quickly and got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wire you from Miradero,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      find the message in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, mastering herself with a difficult effort, held out her hand to
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t be persuaded,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;then good&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he broke in quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad luck. We
      shall be all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, then,&rdquo; returned his friend, and turned away into
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, with one foot in the boat, gave a little shove and caught up his
      oars. An unseen hand of indeterminable might grasped the keel and moved
      them quietly, evenly, outward and forward, puppets given into the custody
      of the unregarding powers. Oars poised and ready, Ban sat with his back
      toward his passenger, facing watchfully downstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning back into the curve of the bow, Io gave herself up to the pulsing
      sweep of the night. Far, far above her stirred a cosmic tumult. The air
      might have been filled with vast wings, invisible and incessant in the
      night of wonders. The moon plunged headlong through the clouds, now
      submerged, now free, like a strong swimmer amidst surf. She moved to the
      music of a tremendous, trumpeting note, the voice of the unleashed Spring,
      male and mighty, exulting in his power, while beneath, the responsive,
      desirous earth thrilled and trembled and was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat, a tiny speck on the surface of chaos, darted and checked and
      swerved lightly at the imperious bidding of unguessed forces, reaching up
      from the depths to pluck at it in elfish sportiveness. Only when Ban
      thrust down the oar-blades, as he did now and again to direct their course
      or avoid some obstacle, was Io made sensible, through the jar and tremor
      of the whole structure, how swiftly they moved. She felt the spirit of the
      great motion, of which they were a minutely inconsiderable part, enter
      into her soul. She was inspired of it, freed, elated, glorified. She
      lifted up her voice and sang. Ban, turning, gave her one quick look of
      comprehension, then once more was intent and watchful of their master and
      servitor, the flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed an oar to indicate that he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back and sit by me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the boat go where it wants to! The river will take care of us.
      It&rsquo;s a good river, and so strong! I think it loves to have us here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ban shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let the great river bear us to the sea,&rsquo;&rdquo; sang
      Io in her fresh and thrilling voice, stirring the uttermost fibers of his
      being with delight. &ldquo;Ban, can&rsquo;t you trust the river and the
      night and&mdash;and the mad gods? I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he shook his head. In his attitude she sensed a new concentration
      upon something ahead. She became aware of a strange stir that was not of
      the air nor the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; said something
      unseen, with an immense effect of restraint and enforced quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat slewed sharply as Banneker checked their progress with a
      downthrust of oars. He edged in toward the farther bank which was quite
      flat, studying it with an eye to the most favoring spot, having selected
      which, he ran the stern up with several hard shoves, leapt out, hauled the
      body of the craft free from the balked and snatching current, and held out
      a hand to his passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked as she joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m trying to think where I&rsquo;ve
      heard that noise before.&rdquo; He pondered. &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ve got it!
      It was when I was out on the coast in the big rains, and a few million
      tons of river-bank let go all holds and smushed down into the stream....
      What&rsquo;s on your map?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over it, conning its detail by the light of the flash which she
      turned on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be about here,&rdquo; he indicated, touching the paper,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ahead and take a look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I go with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stay quiet and get all the rest you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone some twenty minutes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big, fresh-looking
      split-off in the opposite bank,&rdquo; he reported; &ldquo;and the water
      looks fizzy and whirly around there. I think we&rsquo;ll give her a little
      time to settle. A sudden shift underneath might suck us down. The water&rsquo;s
      rising every minute, which makes it worth while waiting. Besides, it&rsquo;s
      dark just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in fate?&rdquo; asked the girl abruptly, as he
      seated himself on the sand beside her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly,
      schoolgirl thing to say, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;But I
      was thinking of this boat being there in the middle of the dry desert,
      just when we needed it most.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had been there some time,&rdquo; pointed out Banneker. &ldquo;And
      if we couldn&rsquo;t have come this way, I&rsquo;d have found some other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you would,&rdquo; crowed Io softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, I don&rsquo;t believe in fate; not the ready-made kind. Things
      aren&rsquo;t that easy. If I did&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did?&rdquo; she prompted as he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get back into the boat with you and throw away the oars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare you!&rdquo; she cried recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d go whirling and spinning along,&rdquo; he continued with
      dreams in his voice, &ldquo;until dawn came, and then we&rsquo;d go ashore
      and camp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know? In the Enchanted Canyon where it enters the
      Mountains of Fulfillment.... They&rsquo;re not on this map.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not on any map. More&rsquo;s the pity. And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d rest. And after that we&rsquo;d climb to the
      Plateau Beyond the Clouds where the Fadeless Gardens are, and there...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There we&rsquo;d hear the Undying Voices singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should we sing, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. &lsquo;For they who attain these heights, through pain
      of upward toil and the rigors of abstention, are as the demigods, secure
      above evil and the fear thereof.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, but I hate the &lsquo;upward toil&rsquo;
      part of it, and the &lsquo;abstention&rsquo; even more. We ought to be
      able to become demigods without all that, just because we wish it. In a
      fairy-tale, anyway. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a really competent
      fairy-tale-monger, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t let me go on to the &lsquo;live happy ever after&rsquo;
      part,&rdquo; he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the serpent, the lying, poisoning little serpent,
      always concealed in the gardens of dreams. They don&rsquo;t, Ban; people
      don&rsquo;t live happy ever after. I could believe in fairy-tales up to
      that point. Just there ugly old Experience holds up her bony finger&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      a horrid hag, Ban, but we&rsquo;d all be dead or mad without her&mdash;and
      points to the wriggling little snake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my garden,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d have shining wings
      and eyes that could look to the future as well as to the past, and
      immortal Hope for a lover. It would be worth all the toil and the
      privation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever made up a Paradise,&rdquo; said the girl fretfully,
      &ldquo;but what the Puritan in him set the road with sharp stones and
      bordered it with thorns and stings.... Look, Ban! Here&rsquo;s the moon
      come back to us.... And see what&rsquo;s laughing at us and our dreams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the crest of a sand-billow sprawled a huge organ-cactus, brandishing
      its arms in gnomish derision of their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can one help but believe in foul spirits with that thing to
      prove their existence?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And, look! There&rsquo;s
      the good spirit in front of that shining cloud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a yucca in full, creamy flower; a creature of unearthly
      purity in the glow of the moon, a dream-maiden beckoning at the gates of
      darkness to a world of hidden and ineffable beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw my first yucca in blossom,&rdquo; said Banneker, &ldquo;it
      was just before sunrise after I had been riding all night, and I came on
      it around a dip in the hills, standing alone against a sky of pearl and
      silver. It made me think of a ghost, the ghost of a girl who had died too
      young to know womanhood, died while she was asleep and dreaming pale, soft
      dreams, never to be fulfilled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the injustice of death,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To
      take one before one knows and has felt and been all that there is to know
      and feel and be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet&rdquo;&mdash;he turned a slow smile to her&mdash;&ldquo;you
      were just now calling Experience bad names; a horrid hag, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, she&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; retorted the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, I want to go on. The whole universe is in motion. Why must we
      stand still?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They reëmbarked. The grip of the hurrying depths took them past crinkly
      water, lustrously bronze in the moonlight where the bank had given way,
      and presently delivered them, around the shoulder of a low, brush-crowned
      bluff, into the keeping of a swollen creek. Here the going was more
      tricky. There were shoals and whirls at the bends, and plunging flotsam to
      be avoided. Banneker handled the boat with masterly address, easing her
      through the swift passages, keeping her, with a touch here and a dip
      there, to the deepest flow, swerving adroitly to dodge the trees and brush
      which might have punctured the thin metal. Once he cried out and lunged at
      some object with an unshipped oar. It rolled and sank, but not before Io
      had caught the contour of a pasty face. She was startled rather than
      horrified at this apparition of death. It seemed an accessory proper to
      the pattern of the bewitched night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a little, silvered surf of cross-waves, they were shot, after an
      hour of this uneasy going, into the broad, clean sweep of the Little
      Bowleg River. After the troubled progress of the lesser current it seemed
      very quiet and secure; almost placid. But the banks slipped by in an
      endless chain. Presently they came abreast of three horsemen riding the
      river trail, who urged their horses into a gallop, keeping up with them
      for a mile or more. As they fell away, Io waved a handkerchief at them, to
      which they made response by firing a salvo from their revolvers into the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making better than ten miles an hour,&rdquo; Banneker
      called over his shoulder to his passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shot between the split halves of a little, scraggly, ramshackle town,
      danced in white water where the ford had been, and darted onward. Now
      Banneker began to hold against the current, scanning the shores until,
      with a quick wrench, he brought the stern around and ran it up on a muddy
      bit of strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grub!&rdquo; he announced gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languor had taken possession of Io, the languor of one who yields to
      unknown and fateful forces. Passive and at peace, she wanted nothing but
      to be wafted by the current to whatever far bourne might await her. That
      there should be such things as railway trains and man-made schedules in
      this world of winds and mystery and the voice of great waters, was hard to
      believe; hardly worth believing in any case. Better not to think of it:
      better to muse on her companion, building fire as the first man had built
      for the first woman, to feed and comfort her in an environment of imminent
      fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coffee, when her man brought it, seemed too artificial for the time and
      place. She shook her head. She was not hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; insisted Ban. He pointed downstream where the murk
      lay heavy. &ldquo;We shall run into more rain. You will need the warmth
      and support of food.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, because there were only they two on the face of the known earth, woman
      and man, the woman obeyed the man. To her surprise, she found that she was
      hungry, ardently hungry. Both ate heartily. It was a silent meal; little
      spoken except about the chances and developments of the journey, until she
      got to her feet. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never, as long as I live, wherever I go, whatever I do,
      know anything like this again. I shall not want to. I want it to stand
      alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will stand alone,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met the rain within half an hour, a wall-like mass of it. It blotted
      out everything around them. The roar of it cut off sound, as the mass of
      it cut off sight. Fortunately the boat was now going evenly as in an oiled
      groove. By feeling, Io knew that her guide was moving from his seat, and
      guessed that he was bailing. The spare poncho, put in by Miss Van Arsdale,
      protected her. She was jubilant with the thresh of the rain in her face,
      the sweet, smooth motion of the boat beneath her, the wild abandon of the
      night, which, entering into her blood, had transmuted it into soft fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long she crouched, exultant and exalted, under the beat of the storm,
      she could not guess. She half emerged from her possession with a strange
      feeling that the little craft was being irresistibly drawn forward and
      downward in what was now a suction rather than a current. At the same time
      she felt the spring and thrust of Banneker&rsquo;s muscles, straining at
      the oars. She dipped a hand into the water. It ridged high around her
      wrists with a startling pressure. What was happening?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the uproar she could dimly hear Ban&rsquo;s voice. He seemed to be
      swearing insanely. Dropping to her hands and knees, for the craft was now
      swerving and rocking, she crept to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dam! The dam! The dam!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      forgotten about it. Go back. Turn on the flash. Look for shore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Against rather than into that impenetrable enmeshment of rain, the glow
      dispersed itself ineffectually. Io sat, not frightened so much as
      wondering. Her body ached in sympathy with the panting, racking toil of
      the man at the oars, the labor of an indomitable pigmy, striving to thwart
      a giant&rsquo;s will. Suddenly he shouted. The boat spun. Something low
      and a shade blacker than the dull murk about them, with a white,
      whispering ripple at its edge, loomed. The boat&rsquo;s prow drove into
      soft mud as Banneker, all but knocking her overboard in his dash, plunged
      to the land and with one powerful lift, brought boat and cargo to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he leaned, gasping, against a stump. When he spoke, it was to
      reproach himself bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have come through the town. There&rsquo;s a dam below it. I&rsquo;d
      forgotten it. My God! If we hadn&rsquo;t had the luck to strike shore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a high dam?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this flood we&rsquo;d be pounded to death the moment we were
      over. Listen! You can hear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had diminished a little. Above its insistence sounded a deeper,
      more formidable beat and thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be quite close to it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few rods, probably. Let me have the light. I want to explore
      before we start out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much sooner than she had expected, he was back. He groped for and took her
      hand. His own was steady, but his voice shook as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve called me that. Well, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you stand it to&mdash;to have me tell you something?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not on the shore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, then? An island?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any islands here. It must be a bit of the
      mainland cut off by the flood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. We can stand
      it until dawn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wavelet lapped quietly across her foot. She withdrew it and with that
      involuntary act came understanding. Her hand, turning in his, pressed
      close, palm cleaving to palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much longer?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long. It&rsquo;s just a tiny patch. And the river is rising
      every minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps two hours. Perhaps less. My good God! If there&rsquo;s any
      special hell for criminal fools, I ought to go to it for bringing you to
      this,&rdquo; he burst out in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought you. Whatever there is, we&rsquo;ll go to it together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful beyond all wonders. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It isn&rsquo;t so much fear, though I dread to
      think of that hammering-down weight of water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried brokenly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to
      think of you&mdash;&rdquo; He lifted his head sharply. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      it lightening up? Look! Can you see shore? We might be quite near.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She peered out, leaning forward. &ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;
      Her hand turned within his, released itself gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      afraid,&rdquo; she said, speaking clear and swift. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      that. But I&rsquo;m&mdash;rebellious. I hate the idea of it, of ending
      everything; the unfairness of it. To have to die without knowing the&mdash;the
      realness of life. Unfulfilled. It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; she accused
      breathlessly. &ldquo;Ban, it&rsquo;s what we were saying. Back there on
      the river-bank where the yucca stands. I don&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t bear to go&mdash;before I&rsquo;ve known ... before....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arms crept to enfold him. Her lips sought his, tremulous,
      surrendering, demanding in surrender. With all the passion and longing
      that he had held in control, refusing to acknowledge even their existence,
      as if the mere recognition of them would have blemished her, he caught her
      to him. He heard her, felt her sob once. The roar of the cataract was
      louder, more insistent in his ears ... or was it the rush of the blood in
      his veins?... Io cried out, a desolate and hungry cry, for he had wrenched
      his mouth from hers. She could feel the inner man abruptly withdrawn,
      concentrated elsewhere. She opened her eyes upon an appalling radiance
      wherein his face stood out clear, incredulous, then suddenly eager and
      resolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a headlight!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A train! Look, Io!
      The mainland. It&rsquo;s only a couple of rods away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped from her arms, ran to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she called weakly. &ldquo;Ban! You
      can never make it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to. It&rsquo;s our only chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he was fumbling under the seat. He brought out a coil of
      rope. Throwing off poncho, coat, and waistcoat, he coiled the lengths
      around his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me swim with you,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not strong enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. We&rsquo;d go together ... I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      face it alone, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to. Or give up our only chance of life. You must,
      Io. If I shouldn&rsquo;t get across, you may try it; the chances of the
      current might help you. But not until after you&rsquo;re sure I haven&rsquo;t
      made it. You must wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I get to shore, I&rsquo;ll throw the rope across to you.
      Listen for it. I&rsquo;ll keep throwing until it strikes where you can get
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may help. Then you make fast under the forward seat of the
      boat. Be sure it&rsquo;s tight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twitch three times on the rope to let me know when you&rsquo;re
      ready and shove out and upstream as strongly as you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you hold it against the current?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. If I do, you&rsquo;ll drift around against the bank. If I
      don&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ban,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Not you, too. There&rsquo;s no
      need&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her gently, stepped back, took a run and flung himself upward
      and outward into the ravening current.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw a foaming thresh that melted into darkness....
    </p>
    <p>
      Time seemed to have stopped for her. She waited, waited, waited in a world
      wherein only Death waited with her.... Ban was now limp and lifeless
      somewhere far downstream, asprawl in the swiftness, rolling a pasty face
      to the sky like that grisly wayfarer who had hailed them silently in the
      upper reach of the river, a messenger and prophet of their fate. The
      rising waters eddied about her feet. The boat stirred uneasily.
      Mechanically she drew it back from the claim of the flood. A light blow
      fell upon her cheek and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly and intensely alive, Io tautened it and felt the jerk of Ban&rsquo;s
      signal. With expert hands she made it fast, shipped the oars, twitched the
      cord thrice, and, venturing as far as she dared into the deluge, pushed
      with all her force and threw herself over the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope twanged and hummed like a gigantic bass-string. Io crawled to the
      oars, felt the gunwale dip and right again, and, before she could take a
      stroke, was pressed against the far bank. She clambered out and went to
      Banneker, guiding herself by the light. His face, in the feeble glow,
      shone, twisted in agony. He was shaking from head to foot. The other end
      of the rope which had brought her to safety was knotted fast around his
      waist.... So he would have followed, as he said!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Io&rsquo;s queer, inconsequent brain flitted a grotesque
      conjecture: what would the newspapers make of it if she had been found,
      washed up on the river-bank, and the Manzanita agent of the Atkinson and
      St. Philip Railroad Company drowned and haltered by a long tether to his
      boat, near by? A sensational story!...
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to Banneker, still helplessly shaking, and put her firm, slight
      hands on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Ban,&rdquo; she said soothingly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived safe&rdquo; was the laconic message delivered to Miss
      Camilla Van Arsdale by Banneker&rsquo;s substitute when, after a haggard
      night, she rode over in the morning for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker himself returned on the second noon, after much and roundabout
      wayfaring. He had little to say of the night journey; nothing of the peril
      escaped. Miss Welland had caught a morning train for the East. She was
      none the worse for the adventurous trip. Camilla Van Arsdale, noting his
      rapt expression and his absent, questing eyes, wondered what underlay such
      reticence.... What had been the manner of their parting?
    </p>
    <p>
      It had, indeed, been anti-climax. Both had been a little shy, a little
      furtive. Each, perhaps feeling a mutual strain, wanted the parting over,
      restlessly desiring the sedative of thought and quiet memory after that
      stress. The desperate peril from which they had been saved seemed a lesser
      crisis, leading from a greater and more significant one; leading to&mdash;what?
      For his part Banneker was content to &ldquo;breathe and wait.&rdquo; When
      they should meet again, it would be determined. How and when the encounter
      might take place, he did not trouble himself to consider. The whole
      universe was moulded and set for that event. Meantime the glory was about
      him; he could remember, recall, repeat, interpret....
    </p>
    <p>
      For the hundredth time&mdash;or was it the thousandth?&mdash;he
      reconstructed that last hour of theirs together in the station at
      Miradero, waiting for the train. What had they said to each other?
      Commonplaces, mostly, and at times with effort, as if they were making
      conversation. They two! After that passionate and revealing moment between
      life and death on the island. What should he have said to her? Begged her
      to stay? On what basis? How could he?.... As the distant roar of the train
      warned them that the time of parting was close, it was she who broke
      through that strange restraint, turning upon him her old-time limpid and
      resolute regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban; promise me something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be a time coming for us when you won&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me. Perhaps I shan&rsquo;t understand myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always understand yourself, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that comes&mdash;when that comes&mdash;Ban, there&rsquo;s
      something in the book, <i>our</i> book, that I&rsquo;ve left you to read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Voices&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve fastened the pages together so that you can&rsquo;t
      read it too soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I tell you ... No; not when I tell you. When&mdash;oh, when
      you must! You&rsquo;ll read it, and afterward, when you think of me, you&rsquo;ll
      think of that, too. Will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what happens?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what happens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a litany.&rdquo; She laughed tremulously....
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the train. Good-bye, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the tips of slender fingers on his temples, the light, swift
      pressure of cold lips on his mouth.... While the train pulled out, she
      stood on the rear platform, looking, looking. She was very still. All
      motion, all expression seemed centered in the steady gaze which dwindled
      away from him, became vague ... featureless ... vanished in a lurch of the
      car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, at home again, planted a garden of dreams, and lived in it,
      mechanically acceptant of the outer world, resentful of any intrusion upon
      that flowerful retreat. Even of Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for days thereafter did the Hunger come. It began as a little gnawing
      doubt and disappointment. It grew to a devastating, ravening starvation of
      the heart, for sign or sight or word of Io Welland. It drove him out of
      his withered seclusion, to seek Miss Van Arsdale, in the hope of hearing
      Io&rsquo;s name spoken. But Miss Van Arsdale scarcely referred to Io. She
      watched Banneker with unconcealed anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Why had there been no letter?...
    </p>
    <p>
      Appeasement came in the form of a package addressed in her handwriting.
      Avidly he opened it. It was the promised Bible, mailed from New York City.
      On the fly-leaf was written &ldquo;I.O.W. to E.B.&rdquo;&mdash;nothing
      more. He went through it page by page, seeking marked passages. There was
      none. The doubt settled down on him again. The Hunger bit into him more
      savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Why didn&rsquo;t she write? A word! Anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Had she written Miss Van Arsdale?
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it was intolerable that he should be driven to ask about her from
      any other person; about Io, who had clasped him in the Valley of the
      Shadow, whose lips had made the imminence of death seem a light thing! The
      Hunger drove him to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Miss Van Arsdale had heard. Io Welland was in New York, and well.
      That was all. But Banneker felt an undermining reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long days of changeless sunlight on the desert, an intolerable glare. From
      the doorway of the lonely station Banneker stared out over leagues of sand
      and cactus, arid, sterile, hopeless, promiseless. Life was like that. Four
      weeks now since Io had left him. And still, except for the Bible, no word
      from her. No sign. Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why that? Anything but that! It was too unbearable to his helpless
      masculine need of her. He could not understand it. He could not understand
      anything. Except the Hunger. That he understood well enough now....
    </p>
    <p>
      At two o&rsquo;clock of a savagely haunted night, Banneker staggered from
      his cot. For weeks he had not known sleep otherwise than in fitful
      passages. His brain was hot and blank. Although the room was pitch-dark,
      he crossed it unerringly to a shelf and look down his revolver. Slipping
      on overcoat and shoes, he dropped the weapon into his pocket and set out
      up the railroad track. A half-mile he covered before turning into the
      desert. There he wandered aimlessly for a few minutes, and after that
      groped his way, guarding with a stick against the surrounding threat of
      the cactus, for his eyes were tight closed. Still blind, he drew out the
      pistol, gripped it by the barrel, and threw it, whirling high and far,
      into the trackless waste. He passed on, feeling his uncertain way
      patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took him a quarter of an hour to find the railroad track and set a sure
      course for home, so effectually had he lost himself.... No chance of his
      recovering that old friend. It had been whispering to him, in the
      blackness of empty nights, counsels that were too persuasive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his room over the station he lighted the lamp and stood before the
      few books which he kept with him there; among them Io&rsquo;s Bible and
      &ldquo;The Undying Voices,&rdquo; with the two pages still joined as her
      fingers had left them. He was summoning his courage to face what might be
      the final solution. When he must, she had said, he was to open and read.
      Well ... he must. He could bear it no longer, the wordless uncertainty. He
      lifted down the volume, gently parted the fastened pages and read. From
      out the still, ordered lines, there rose to him the passionate cry of
      protest and bereavement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;............................Nevermore Alone upon the threshold of
      my door Of individual life I shall command The uses of my soul, nor lift
      my hand Serenely in the sunshine as before, Without the sense of that
      which I forbore&mdash;Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land Doom takes
      to part us, leaves thy heart in mine With pulses that beat double. What I
      do And what I dream include thee, as the wine Must taste of its own
      grapes. And when I sue God for myself, He hears that name of thine And
      sees within my eyes the tears of two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over he read it with increasing bewilderment, with increasing
      fear, with slow-developing comprehension. If that was to be her farewell
      ... but why! Io, the straightforward, the intrepid, the exponent of fair
      play and the rules of the game!... Had it been only a game? No; at least
      he knew better than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it all mean? Why that medium for her message? Should he write
      and ask her? But what was there to ask or say, in the face of her silence?
      Besides, he had not even her address. Miss Camilla could doubtless give
      him that. But would she? How much did she understand? Why had she turned
      so unhelpful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sat with his problem half through a searing night; and the other
      half of the night he spent in writing. But not to Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Camilla Van Arsdale rode up to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, Ban?&rdquo; was her greeting, as soon as she saw his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Camilla. I&rsquo;m going away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, confirming not so much what he said as a fulfilled suspicion
      of her own. &ldquo;New York is a very big city,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that I was going to New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; there is much you haven&rsquo;t said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt much like talking. Even to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to. I&rsquo;ve got to get away from here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your position with the railroad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve resigned. It&rsquo;s all arranged.&rdquo; He pointed to
      the pile of letters, his night&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know! I beg your pardon, Miss Camilla. Write, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to write about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The exile, who had spent her years weaving exquisite music from the rhythm
      of desert winds and the overtones of the forest silence, looked about her,
      over the long, yellow-gray stretches pricked out with hints of brightness,
      to the peaceful refuge of the pines, and again to the naked and impudent
      meanness of the town. Across to her ears, borne on the air heavy with rain
      still unshed, came the rollicking, ragging jangle of the piano at the Sick
      Coyote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there people to write about there?&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Tragedies and comedies and the human drama? Barrie found it in a
      duller place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until he had seen the world first,&rdquo; he retorted quickly.
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not a Barrie.... I can&rsquo;t stay here, Miss
      Camilla.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ban! Youth is always expecting life to fulfill itself. It
      doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;unless you make it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will you make it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get on a newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so easy as all that, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the joyous flush of energy, evoked under the spell of Io&rsquo;s
      enchantment, he had filled his spare hours with work, happy, exuberant,
      overflowing with a quaint vitality. A description of the desert in spate,
      thumb-nail sketches from a station-agent&rsquo;s window, queer little
      flavorous stories of crime and adventure and petty intrigue in the town;
      all done with a deftness and brevity that was saved from being too abrupt
      only by broad touches of color and light. And he had had a letter. He told
      Miss Van Arsdale of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;ve a promise, or even a fair expectation of a
      place. But, Ban, I wouldn&rsquo;t go to New York, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His strong eyebrows went up. &ldquo;Use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find her there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not in New York?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard from her, then? Where is she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone abroad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that he meditated. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come back, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, silent, attentive, incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban; she&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegraph instrument clicked in the tiny rhythm of an elfin bass-drum.
      &ldquo;O.S. O.S.&rdquo; Click. Click. Click-click-click. Mechanically
      responsive to his office he answered, and for a moment was concerned with
      some message about a local freight. When he raised his face again, Miss
      Van Arsdale read there a sick and floundering skepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Io! She couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, startled by the conviction in his tone, wondered how much that
      might imply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wrote me,&rdquo; said she presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she was married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she would be by the time the letter reached me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;You will think me a fool,&rdquo; the girl had written impetuously,
      &ldquo;and perhaps a cruel fool. But it is the wise thing, really. Del
      Eyre is so safe! He is safety itself for a girl like me. And I have
      discovered that I can&rsquo;t wholly trust myself.... Be gentle with him,
      and make him do something worth while.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ban. &ldquo;But that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have the newspaper since with an account of the wedding....
      Ban! Don&rsquo;t look like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; said he stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like Pretty Willie as I saw him when he was working
      himself up for the killing.&rdquo; Pretty Willie was the soft-eyed young
      desperado who had cleaned out the Sick Coyote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to kill anybody,&rdquo; he said with a
      touch of grim amusement for her fears. &ldquo;Not even myself.&rdquo; He
      rose and went to the door. &ldquo;Do you mind, Miss Camilla?&rdquo; he
      added appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to leave you now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you leave, Ban, if you do go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning he went, after a night spent in arranging,
      destroying, and burning. The last thing to go into the stove, 67 S 4230,
      was a lock of hair, once glossy, but now stiffened and stained a dull
      brown, which he had cut from the wound on Io&rsquo;s head that first,
      strange night of theirs, the stain of her blood that had beaten in her
      heart, and given life to the sure, sweet motion of her limbs, and flushed
      in her cheeks, and pulsed in the warm lips that she had pressed to his&mdash;Why
      could they not have died together on their dissolving island, with the
      night about them, and their last, failing sentience for each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      The flame of the greedy stove licked up the memento, but not the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not worry about me,&rdquo; he wrote in the note left with
      his successor for Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;I shall be all right. I am
      going to succeed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brashear&rsquo;s rooming-house on Grove Street wore its air of
      respectability like a garment, clean and somber, in an environment of
      careful behavior. Greenwich Village, not having fully awakened to the
      commercial advantages of being a <i>locale</i>, had not yet stretched
      between itself and the rest of New York that gauzy and iridescent curtain
      of sprightly impropriety and sparkling intellectual naughtiness, since
      faded to a lather tawdry pattern. An early pioneer of the Villager type,
      emancipated of thought and speech, chancing upon No. 11 Grove, would have
      despised it for its lack of atmosphere and its patent conservatism. It did
      not go out into the highways and byways, seeking prospective lodgers. It
      folded its hands and waited placidly for them to come. When they came, it
      pondered them with care, catechized them tactfully, and either rejected
      them with courteous finality or admitted them on probation. Had it been
      given to self-exploitation, it could have boasted that never had it
      harbored a bug or a scandal within its doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on this filmy-soft April day it was nonplussed. A type new to its
      experience was applying for a room, and Mrs. Brashear, who was not only
      the proprietress, but, as it were, the familiar spirit and incarnation of
      the institution, sat peering near-sightedly and in some perturbation of
      soul at the phenomenon. He was young, which was against him, and of a
      winning directness of manner, which was in his favor, and extremely good
      to look at, which was potential of complications, and encased in clothing
      of an uncompromising cut and neutral pattern (to wit; No. 45 T 370,
      &ldquo;an ideal style for a young business man of affairs; neat,
      impressive and dignified&rdquo;), which was reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Banneker,&rdquo; he had said, immediately the door was
      opened to him. &ldquo;Can I get a room here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a room vacant,&rdquo; admitted the spirit of the house
      unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he was mounting the stairs; she must, perforce, follow. On
      the third floor she passed him and led the way to a small, morosely
      papered front room, almost glaringly clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, if I can have a work-table in it and if it isn&rsquo;t
      too much,&rdquo; he said, after one comprehensive glance around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price is five dollars a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Banneker but known it, this was rather high. The Brashear
      rooming-house charged for its cleanliness, physical and moral. &ldquo;Can
      I move in at once?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you nor anything about you, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo;
      she replied, but not until they had descended the stairs and were in the
      cool, dim parlor. At the moment of speaking, she raised a shade, as if to
      help in the determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that necessary? They didn&rsquo;t ask me when I registered at
      the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brashear stared, then smiled. &ldquo;A hotel is different. Where are
      you stopping?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the St. Denis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice place. Who directed you here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one. I strolled around until I found a street I liked, and
      looked around until I found a house I liked. The card in the window&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Well, Mr. Banneker, for the protection of the house I
      must have references.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;References? You mean letters from people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily. Just a name or two from whom I can make inquiries.
      You have friends, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your family&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the people in the place where you work. What is your business,
      by the way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect to go on a newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect?&rdquo; Mrs. Brashear stiffened in defense of the
      institution. &ldquo;You have no place yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered not her question, but her doubt. &ldquo;As far as that is
      concerned, I&rsquo;ll pay in advance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the financial consideration,&rdquo; she began
      loftily&mdash;&ldquo;alone,&rdquo; she added more honestly. &ldquo;But to
      take in a total stranger&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker leaned forward to her. &ldquo;See here, Mrs. Brashear; there&rsquo;s
      nothing wrong about me. I don&rsquo;t get drunk. I don&rsquo;t smoke in
      bed. I&rsquo;m decent of habit and I&rsquo;m clean. I&rsquo;ve got money
      enough to carry me. Couldn&rsquo;t you take me on my say-so? Look me over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was delivered with entire gravity, the speech provoked a tired
      and struggling smile on the landlady&rsquo;s plain features. She looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he queried pleasantly. &ldquo;What do you think? Will
      you take a chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That suppressed motherliness which, embodying the unformulated desire to
      look after and care for others, turns so many widows to taking lodgers,
      found voice in Mrs. Brashear&rsquo;s reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a spell of sickness, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, a little sharply. &ldquo;Where did you get that
      idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes look hot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping very well. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad. You&rsquo;ve had a loss, maybe,&rdquo; she ventured
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A loss? No.... Yes. You might call it a loss. You&rsquo;ll take me,
      then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can move in right away,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brashear recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Brashear rooming-house took into its carefully guarded interior the
      young and unknown Mr. Banneker&mdash;who had not been sleeping well. Nor
      did he seem to be sleeping well in his new quarters, since his light was
      to be seen glowing out upon the quiet street until long after midnight;
      yet he was usually up betimes, often even before the moving spirit of the
      house, herself. A full week had he been there before his fellow lodgers,
      self-constituted into a Committee on Membership, took his case under
      consideration in full session upon the front steps. None had had speech
      with him, but it was known that he kept irregular hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his job: that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo;
      demanded in a tone of challenge, young Wickert, a man of the world who
      clerked in the decorative department of a near-by emporium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newsboy, I guess,&rdquo; said Lambert, the belated art-student of
      thirty-odd with a grin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always got his arms full of
      papers when he comes in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he sits at his table clipping pieces out of them and arranging
      them in piles,&rdquo; volunteered little Mrs. Bolles, the trained nurse on
      the top floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him as I go past.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help-wanted ads,&rdquo; suggested Wickert, who had suffered
      experience in that will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he hasn&rsquo;t got a job,&rdquo; deduced Mr. Hainer, a heavy
      man of heavy voice and heavy manner, middle-aged, a small-salaried
      accountant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s got money,&rdquo; suggested Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or maybe he&rsquo;s a dead beat; he looks on the queer,&rdquo;
      opined young Wickert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a very fine and sensitive face. I think he has been ill.&rdquo;
      The opinion came from a thin, quietly dressed woman of the early worn-out
      period of life, who sat a little apart from the others. Young Wickert
      started a sniff, but suppressed it, for Miss Westlake was held locally in
      some degree of respect, as being &ldquo;well-connected&rdquo; and having
      relatives who called on her in their own limousines, though seldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody know his name?&rdquo; asked Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barnacle,&rdquo; said young Wickert wittily. &ldquo;Something like
      that, anyway. Bannsocker, maybe. Guess he&rsquo;s some sort of a Swede.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I only hope he doesn&rsquo;t clear out some night with his
      trunk on his back and leave poor Mrs. Brashear to whistle,&rdquo; declared
      Mrs. Bolles piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worn face of the landlady, with its air of dispirited motherliness,
      appeared in the doorway. &ldquo;Mr. Banneker is a <i>gentleman</i>,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleman&rdquo; from Mrs. Brashear, with that intonation, meant
      one who, out of or in a job, paid his room rent. The new lodger had earned
      the title by paying his month in advance. Having settled that point, she
      withdrew, followed by the two other women. Lambert, taking a floppy hat
      from the walnut rack in the hall, went his way, leaving young Wickert and
      Mr. Hainer to support the discussion, which they did in tones less
      discreet than the darkness warranted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would he hail from, would you think?&rdquo; queried the
      elder. &ldquo;Iowa, maybe? Or Arkansas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; answered young Wickert. &ldquo;But it was a
      small-town carpenter built those honest-to-Gawd clothes. I&rsquo;d say the
      corn-belt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dressed up for the monthly meeting of the Farmers&rsquo; Alliance,
      all but the oil on his hair. He forgot that,&rdquo; chuckled the
      accountant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a fine chance in Nuh Yawk&mdash;of buying a gold
      brick cheap,&rdquo; prophesied the worldly Wickert out of the depths of
      his metropolitan experience. &ldquo;Somebody ought to put him onto
      himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the darkened window above said, with composure, &ldquo;That
      will be all right. I&rsquo;ll apply to you for advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gee!&rdquo; whispered young Wickert, in appeal to his
      companion. &ldquo;How long&rsquo;s he been there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Acute hearing, it appeared, was an attribute of the man above, for he
      answered at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just put my head out for a breath of air when I heard your kind
      expressions of solicitude. Why? Did I miss something that came earlier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hainer melted unostentatiously into the darkness. While young Wickert
      was debating whether his pride would allow him to follow this prudent
      example, the subject of their over-frank discussion appeared at his elbow.
      Evidently he was as light of foot as he was quick of ear. Meditating
      briefly upon these physical qualities, young Wickert said, in a
      deprecatory tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to get fresh with you. It was just talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wickert produced a suspiciously jeweled case. &ldquo;Have a cigarette?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some of my own, thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you a light?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The metropolitan worldling struck a match and held it up. This was on the
      order of strategy. He wished to see Banneker&rsquo;s face. To his relief
      it did not look angry or even stern. Rather, it appeared thoughtful.
      Banneker was considering impartially the matter of his apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with my clothes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;well,&rdquo; began Wickert, unhappy and fumbling with his
      ideas; &ldquo;Oh, <i>they</i>&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a meeting of the Farmers&rsquo; Alliance.&rdquo; Banneker was
      smiling good-naturedly. &ldquo;But for the East?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you really want to know,&rdquo; began Wickert doubtfully.
      &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t get sore&mdash;&rdquo; Banneker nodded his
      assurance. &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re jay. No style. No snap. Respectable,
      and that lets &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look as if they were made in New York or for New
      York?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Wickert apportioned his voice equitably between a laugh and a
      snort. &ldquo;No: nor in Hoboken!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Listen,
      &lsquo;bo,&rdquo; he added, after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;You got
      to have a smooth shell in Nuh Yawk. The human eye only sees the surface.
      Get me? And it judges by the surface.&rdquo; He smoothed his hands down
      his dapper trunk with ineffable complacency. &ldquo;Thirty-eight dollars,
      this. Bernholz Brothers, around on Broadway. Look it over. That&rsquo;s a
      cut!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that how they&rsquo;re making them in the East?&rdquo;
      doubtfully asked the neophyte, reflecting that the pinched-in snugness of
      the coat, and the flare effect of the skirts, while unquestionably more
      impressive than his own box-like garb, still lacked something of the quiet
      distinction which he recalled in the clothes of Herbert Cressey. The
      thought of that willing messenger set him to groping for another sartorial
      name. He hardly heard Wickert say proudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Bernholz&rsquo;s makes &rsquo;em that way, you can bet it&rsquo;s
      up to the split-second of date, and <i>maybe</i> they beat the pistol by a
      jump. I bluffed for a raise of five dollars, on the strength of this
      outfit, and got it off the bat. There&rsquo;s the suit paid for in two
      months and a pair of shoes over.&rdquo; He thrust out a leg, from below
      the sharp-pressed trouser-line of which protruded a boot trimmed in a sort
      of bizarre fretwork. &ldquo;Like me to take you around to Bernholz&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head. The name for which he sought had come to him.
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Mertoun, somewhere on Fifth Avenue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;ve seen Central Park and the Statue of Liberty,&rdquo;
      railed the other. &ldquo;Thinkin&rsquo; of patternizing Mertoun, was you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to! There&rsquo;s a party at the Astorbilt&rsquo;s to-morrow
      night; you&rsquo;d <i>like</i> to go to that, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Fat
      chance!&rdquo; said the disdainful and seasoned cit. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you
      know what Mertoun would do to you? Set you back a hundred simoleons soon
      as look at you. And at that you got to have a letter of introduction like
      gettin&rsquo; in to see the President of the United States or John D.
      Rockefeller. Come off, my boy! Bernholz&rsquo;s &lsquo;ll fix you just as
      good, all but the label. Better come around to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, but I&rsquo;m not buying yet. Where would you say a
      fellow would have a chance to see the best-dressed men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Wickert looked at once self-conscious and a trifle miffed, for
      in his own set he was regarded as quite the mould of fashion. &ldquo;Oh,
      well, if you want to pipe off the guys that <i>think</i> they&rsquo;re the
      whole thing, walk up the Avenue and watch the doors of the clubs and the
      swell restaurants. At that, they haven&rsquo;t got anything on some
      fellows that don&rsquo;t spend a quarter of the money, but know what&rsquo;s
      what and don&rsquo;t let grafters like Mertoun pull their legs,&rdquo;
      said he. &ldquo;Say, you seem to know what you want, all right, all right,&rdquo;
      he added enviously. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to let this little
      old town bluff you; ay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not for lack of a few clothes. Good-night,&rdquo; replied
      Banneker, leaving in young Wickert&rsquo;s mind the impression that he was
      &ldquo;a queer gink,&rdquo; but also, on the whole, &ldquo;a good guy.&rdquo;
      For the worldling was only small, not mean of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker might have added that one who had once known cities and the
      hearts of men from the viewpoint of that modern incarnation of Ulysses,
      the hobo, contemptuous and predatory, was little likely to be overawed by
      the most teeming and headlong of human ant-heaps. Having joined the
      ant-heap, Banneker was shrewdly concerned with the problem of conforming
      to the best type of termite discoverable. The gibes of the doorstep
      chatterers had not aroused any new ambition; they had merely given point
      to a purpose deferred because of other and more immediate pressure.
      Already he had received from Camilla Van Arsdale a letter rich in
      suggestion, hint, and subtly indicated advice, with this one passage of
      frank counsel:
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were writing, spinster-aunt-wise, to any one else in your position, I
      should be tempted to moralize and issue warnings about&mdash;well, about
      the things of the spirit. But you are equipped, there. Like the &ldquo;Master,&rdquo;
      you will &ldquo;go your own way with inevitable motion.&rdquo; With the
      outer man&mdash;that is different. You have never given much thought to
      that phase. And you have an asset in your personal appearance. I should
      not be telling you this if I thought there were danger of your becoming
      vain. But I really think it would be a good investment for you to put
      yourself into the hands of a first-class tailor, and follow his advice, in
      moderation, of course. Get the sense of being fittingly turned out by
      going where there are well-dressed people; to the opera, perhaps, and the
      theater occasionally, and, when you can afford it, to a good restaurant.
      Unless the world has changed, people will look at you. <i>But you must not
      know it</i>. Important, this is!... I could, of course, give you letters
      of introduction. &ldquo;<i>Les morts vont vite</i>,&rdquo; it is true, and
      I am dead to that world, not wholly without the longings of a would-be <i>revenant</i>;
      but a ghost may still claim some privileges of memory, and my friends
      would be hospitable to you. Only, I strongly suspect that you would not
      use the letters if I gave them. You prefer to make your own start; isn&rsquo;t
      it so? Well; I have written to a few. Sooner or later you will meet with
      them. Those things always happen even in New York.... Be sure to write me
      all about the job when you get it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prudence dictated that he should be earning something before he invested
      in expensive apparel, be it never so desirable and important. However, he
      would outfit himself just as soon as a regular earning capacity justified
      his going into his carefully husbanded but dwindling savings. He pictured
      himself clad as a lily of the field, unconscious of perfection as Herbert
      Cressey himself, in the public haunts of fashion and ease; through which
      vision there rose the searing prospect of thus encountering Io Welland.
      What was her married name? He had not even asked when the news was broken
      to him; had not wanted to ask; was done with all that for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still pathetically young and inexperienced. And he had been badly
      hurt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dust was the conspicuous attribute of the place. It lay, flat and
      toneless, upon the desk, the chairs, the floor; it streaked the walls. The
      semi-consumptive office &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s&rdquo; middle-aged shoulders
      collected it. It stirred in the wake of quiet-moving men, mostly under
      thirty-five, who entered the outer door, passed through the waiting-room,
      and disappeared behind a partition. Banneker felt like shaking himself
      lest he should be eventually buried under its impalpable sifting. Two
      hours and a half had passed since he had sent in his name on a slip of
      paper, to Mr. Gordon, managing editor of the paper. On the way across Park
      Row he had all but been persuaded by a lightning printer on the curb to
      have a dozen tasty and elegant visiting-cards struck off, for a quarter;
      but some vague inhibition of good taste checked him. Now he wondered if a
      card would have served better.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he waited, he checked up the actuality of a metropolitan newspaper
      entrance-room, as contrasted with his notion of it, derived from motion
      pictures. Here was none of the bustle and hurry of the screen. No brisk
      and earnest young figures with tense eyes and protruding notebooks darted
      feverishly in and out; nor, in the course of his long wait, had he seen so
      much as one specimen of that invariable concomitant of all screen
      journalism, the long-haired poet with his flowing tie and neatly ribboned
      manuscript. Even the office &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; lethargic, neutrally
      polite, busy writing on half-sheets of paper, was profoundly untrue to the
      pictured type. Banneker wondered what the managing editor would be like;
      would almost, in the wreckage of his preconceived notions, have accepted a
      woman or a priest in that manifestation, when Mr. Gordon appeared and was
      addressed by name by the hollow-chested Cerberus. Banneker at once echoed
      the name, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor, a tall, heavy man, whose smoothly fitting cutaway
      coat seemed miraculously to have escaped the plague of dust, stared at him
      above heavy glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I sent in my name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At two-forty-seven, thirty,&rdquo; replied the visitor with
      railroad accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look above the lowered glasses became slightly quizzical. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      exact, at least. Patient, too. Good qualities for a newspaper man. That&rsquo;s
      what you are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m going to be,&rdquo; amended Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no opening here at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s formula, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the young man,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other stared. &ldquo;It is. But how do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the tone, I suppose. I&rsquo;ve had to use it a good
      deal myself, in railroading.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observant, as well as exact and patient. Come in. I&rsquo;m sorry I
      misplaced your card. The name is&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banneker, E. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the editor, he passed through a large, low-ceilinged room,
      filled with desk-tables, each bearing a heavy crystal ink-well full of a
      fluid of particularly virulent purple. A short figure, impassive as a
      Mongol, sat at a corner desk, gazing out over City Hall Park with a rapt
      gaze. Across from him a curiously trim and graceful man, with a strong
      touch of the Hibernian in his elongated jaw and humorous gray eyes,
      clipped the early evening editions with an effect of highly judicious
      selection. Only one person sat in all the long files of the work-tables,
      littered with copy-paper and disarranged newspapers; a dark young giant
      with the discouraged and hurt look of a boy kept in after school. All this
      Banneker took in while the managing editor was disposing, usually with a
      single penciled word or number, of a sheaf of telegraphic &ldquo;queries&rdquo;
      left upon his desk. Having finished, he swiveled in his chair, to face
      Banneker, and, as he spoke, kept bouncing the thin point of a
      letter-opener from the knuckles of his left hand. His hands were fat and
      nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you want to do newspaper work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can make a go of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any experience?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None to speak of. I&rsquo;ve written a few things. I thought you
      might remember my name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name? Banneker? No. Why should I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You published some of my things in the Sunday edition, lately. From
      Manzanita, California.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think so. Mr. Homans.&rdquo; A graying man with
      the gait of a marionnette and the precise expression of a rocking-horse,
      who had just entered, crossed over. &ldquo;Have we sent out any checks to
      a Mr. Banneker recently, in California?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new arrival, who was copy-reader and editorial selecter for the Sunday
      edition, repeated the name in just such a wooden voice as was to be
      expected. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve cashed the checks,&rdquo; returned Banneker, annoyed
      and bewildered. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve seen the clipping of the article in
      the Sunday Sphere of&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment. You&rsquo;re not in The Sphere office. Did you think
      you were? Some one has directed you wrong. This is The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;It was a policeman that pointed it
      out. I suppose I saw wrong.&rdquo; He paused; then looked up ingenuously.
      &ldquo;But, anyway, I&rsquo;d rather be on The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon smiled broadly, the thin blade poised over a plump, reddened
      knuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you! Now, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reading it. I like the way it does things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor laughed outright. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t look so honest, I
      would think that somebody of experience had been tutoring you. How many
      other places have you tried?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to The Sphere first? On the promise of a job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Because they printed what I wrote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sphere&rsquo;s ways are not our ways,&rdquo; pronounced Mr.
      Gordon primly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fundamental difference in standards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can, can you?&rdquo; chuckled the other. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      true that we have no opening here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (The Ledger never did have an &ldquo;opening&rdquo;; but it managed to
      wedge in a goodly number of neophytes, from year to year, ninety per cent
      of whom were automatically and courteously ejected after due trial. Mr.
      Gordon performed a surpassing rataplan upon his long-suffering thumb-joint
      and wondered if this queer and direct being might qualify among the
      redeemable ten per cent.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can wait.&rdquo; (They often said that.) &ldquo;For a while,&rdquo;
      added the youth thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been in New York?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-three days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you been doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Reading&mdash;That&rsquo;s rather surprising. All of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I could manage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some were so bad that you couldn&rsquo;t worry through them, eh?&rdquo;
      asked the other with appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that. But I didn&rsquo;t know the foreign languages except
      French, and Spanish, and a little Italian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The foreign-language press, too. Remarkable!&rdquo; murmured the
      other. &ldquo;Do you mind telling me what your idea was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was simple enough. As I wanted to get on a newspaper, I thought
      I ought to find out what newspapers were made of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple, as you say. Beautifully simple! So you&rsquo;ve devised for
      yourself the little job of perfecting yourself in every department of
      journalism; politics, finances, criminal, sports, society; all of them,
      eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not all,&rdquo; replied Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? What have you left out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society news&rdquo; was the answer, delivered less promptly than
      the other replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bestowing a twinkle of mingled amusement and conjecture upon the applicant&rsquo;s
      clothing, Mr. Gordon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t approve of our social records? Or you&rsquo;re not
      interested? Or why is it that you neglect this popular branch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personal reasons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply, which took the managing editor somewhat aback, was accurate if
      not explanatory. Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s commentaries upon Gardner and
      his quest had inspired Banneker with a contemptuous distaste for this type
      of journalism. But chiefly he had shunned the society columns from dread
      of finding there some mention of her who had been Io Welland. He was
      resolved to conquer and evict that memory; he would not consciously put
      himself in the way of anything that recalled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! And this notion of making an intensive study of the papers;
      was that original with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not entirely. I got it from a man who made himself a bank
      president in seven years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? How did he do that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He started by reading everything he could find about money and
      coinage and stocks and bonds and other financial paper. He told me that it
      was incredible the things that financial experts didn&rsquo;t know about
      their own business&mdash;the deep-down things&mdash;and that he guessed it
      was so with any business. He got on top by really knowing the things that
      everybody was supposed to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sound theory, I dare say. Most financiers aren&rsquo;t so
      revealing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and I were padding the hoof together. We were both hoboes then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor looked up, alert, from his knuckle-tapping. &ldquo;From
      bank president to hobo. Was his bank an important one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The biggest in a medium-sized city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does that suggest nothing to you, as a prospective newspaper
      man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Write him up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make a fairly sensational story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that. He was my friend. He wouldn&rsquo;t like
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon addressed his wedding-ring finger which was looking a bit
      scarified. &ldquo;Such an article as that, properly done, would go a long
      way toward getting you a chance on this paper&mdash;Sit down, Mr.
      Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; said Banneker slowly and in the manner of the
      West, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we can.&rdquo; The managing editor threw his steel blade on
      the desk. &ldquo;Sit down, I tell you. And understand this. If you come on
      this paper&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to turn you over to Mr. Greenough, the
      city editor, with a request that he give you a trial&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be
      expected to subordinate every personal interest and advantage to the
      interests and advantages of the paper, <i>except</i> your sense of honor
      and fair-play. We don&rsquo;t ask you to give that up; and if you do give
      it up, we don&rsquo;t want you at all. What have you done besides be a
      hobo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Railroading. Station-agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you educated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere. Wherever I could pick it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means everywhere. Ever read George Borrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy face of Mr. Gordon lighted up. &ldquo;Ree-markable! Keep on. He&rsquo;s
      a good offset to&mdash;to the daily papers. Writing still counts, on The
      Ledger. Come over and meet Mr. Greenough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The city editor unobtrusively studied Banneker out of placid, inscrutable
      eyes, soft as a dove&rsquo;s, while he chatted at large about theaters,
      politics, the news of the day. Afterward the applicant met the Celtic
      assistant, Mr. Mallory, who broadly outlined for him the technique of the
      office. With no further preliminaries Banneker found himself employed at
      fifteen dollars a week, with Monday for his day off and directions to
      report on the first of the month.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day-desk staff was about departing at six o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Gordon
      sauntered over to the city desk looking mildly apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I practically had to take that young desert antelope on,&rdquo;
      said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too ingenuous to turn down,&rdquo; surmised the city editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingenuous! He&rsquo;s heir to the wisdom of the ages. And now I&rsquo;m
      afraid I&rsquo;ve made a ghastly mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something wrong with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had his stuff in the Sunday Sphere looked up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty weird?&rdquo; put in Mallory, gliding into his beautifully
      fitting overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So damned good that I don&rsquo;t see how The Sphere ever came to
      take it. Greenough, you&rsquo;ll have to find some pretext for firing that
      young phenomenon as soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly comprehending his superior&rsquo;s mode of indirect expression
      the city editor replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so highly of him as that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of our jobs will be safe from him if he once gets his foot
      planted,&rdquo; prophesied the other with mock ruefulness. &ldquo;Do you
      know,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I never even asked him for a reference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; pronounced Mallory, shaking the
      last wrinkle out of himself and lighting the cigarette of departure.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it in his face, if I&rsquo;m any judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Highly elate, Banneker walked on springy pavements all the way to Grove
      Street. Fifteen a week! He could live on that. His other income and
      savings could be devoted to carrying out Miss Camilla&rsquo;s advice. For
      he need not save any more. He would go ahead, fast, now that he had got
      his start. How easy it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the Brashear door, he met plain, middle-aged little Miss
      Westlake. A muffler was pressed to her jaw. He recalled having heard her
      moving about her room, the cheapest and least desirable in the house, and
      groaning softly late in the night; also having heard some lodgers say that
      she was a typist with very little work. Obviously she needed a dentist,
      and presumably she had not the money to pay his fee. In the exultation of
      his good luck, Banneker felt a stir of helpfulness toward this helpless
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How do you do! Could you find time to do
      some typing for me quite soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said impulsively and was followed by a surge of dismay. Typing?
      Type what? He had absolutely nothing on hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he must get up something. At once. It would never do to disappoint
      that pathetic and eager hope, as of a last-moment rescue, expressed in the
      little spinster&rsquo;s quick flush and breathless, thankful affirmative.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ten days&rsquo; leeway before entering upon the new work. To which of
      scores of crowding purposes could Banneker best put the time? In his
      offhand way the instructive Mallory had suggested that he familiarize
      himself with the topography and travel-routes of the Island of Manhattan.
      Indefatigably he set about doing this; wandering from water-front to
      water-front, invading tenements, eating at queer, Englishless restaurants,
      picking up chance acquaintance with chauffeurs, peddlers, street-fakers,
      park-bench loiterers; all that drifting and iridescent scum of life which
      variegates the surface above the depths. Everywhere he was accepted
      without question, for his old experience on the hoof had given him the
      uncoded password which loosens the speech of furtive men and wise. A
      receptivity, sensitized to a high degree by the inspiration of new
      adventure, absorbed these impressions. The faithful pocket-ledger was
      filling rapidly with notes and phrases, brisk and trenchant, set down with
      no specific purpose; almost mechanically, in fact, but destined to future
      uses. Mallory, himself no mean connoisseur of the tumultuous and flagrant
      city, would perhaps have found matter foreign to his expert apprehension
      could he have seen and translated the pages of 3 T 9901.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker would go forward in the fascinating paths of exploration; but
      there were other considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer man, for example. The inner man, too; the conscious inner man
      strengthened upon the strong milk of the philosophers, the priests, and
      the prophets so strangely mingled in that library now stored with Camilla
      Van Arsdale; exhilarated by the honey-dew of &ldquo;The Undying Voices,&rdquo;
      of Keats and Shelley, and of Swinburne&rsquo;s supernal rhythms, which he
      had brought with him. One visit to the Public Library had quite appalled
      him; the vast, chill orderliness of it. He had gone there, hungry to chat
      about books! To the Public Library! Surely a Homeric joke for grim, tomish
      officialdom. But tomish officialdom had not even laughed at him; it was
      too official to appreciate the quality of such side-splitting
      innocence.... Was he likely to meet a like irresponsiveness when he should
      seek clothing for the body?
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch the clubs, young Wickert had advised. Banneker strolled up Fifth
      Avenue, branching off here and there, into the more promising side
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour of the First Thirst; the institutions which cater to this
      and subsequent thirsts drew steadily from the main stream of human
      activity flowing past. Many gloriously clad specimens passed in and out of
      the portals, socially sacred as in the quiet Fifth Avenue clubs, profane
      as in the roaring, taxi-bordered &ldquo;athletic&rdquo; foundations; but
      there seemed to the anxious observer no keynote, no homogeneous character
      wherefrom to build as on a sure foundation. Lacking knowledge, his
      instinct could find no starting-point; he was bewildered in vision and in
      mind. Just off the corner of the quietest of the Forties, he met a group
      of four young men, walking compactly by twos. The one nearest him in the
      second line was Herbert Cressey. His heavy and rather dull eye seemed to
      meet Banneker&rsquo;s as they came abreast. Banneker nodded, half checking
      himself in his slow walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said with an accent of surprise and
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cressey&rsquo;s expressionless face turned a little. There was no response
      in kind to Banneker&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! H&rsquo;ware you!&rdquo; said he vaguely, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker advanced mechanically until he reached the corner. There he
      stopped. His color had heightened. The smile was still on his lips; it had
      altered, taken on a quality of gameness. He did not shake his fist at the
      embodied spirit of metropolitanism before him, as had a famous Gallic
      precursor of his, also a determined seeker for Success in a lesser sphere;
      but he paraphrased Rastignac&rsquo;s threat in his own terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll have to lick this town and lick it good before
      it learns to be friendly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand fell on his arm. He turned to face Cressey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the feller that bossed the wreck out there in the
      desert, aren&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re&mdash;lessee&mdash;Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; The tone was curt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry I didn&rsquo;t spot you at once.&rdquo; Cressey&rsquo;s
      genuineness was a sufficient apology. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little stuffy
      to-day. Bachelor dinner last night. What are you doing here? Looking
      around?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m living here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? So am I. Come into my club and let&rsquo;s talk. I&rsquo;m
      glad to see you, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even had Banneker been prone to self-consciousness, which he was not, the
      extreme, almost monastic plainness of the small, neutral-fronted building
      to which the other led him would have set him at ease. It gave no inkling
      of its unique exclusiveness, and equally unique expensiveness. As for
      Cressey, that simple, direct, and confident soul took not the smallest
      account of Banneker&rsquo;s standardized clothing, which made him almost
      as conspicuous in that environment as if he had entered clad in a wooden
      packing-case. Cressey&rsquo;s creed in such matters was complete; any
      friend of his was good enough for any environment to which he might
      introduce him, and any other friend who took exceptions might go farther!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banzai!&rdquo; said the cheerful host over his cocktail. &ldquo;Welcome
      to our city. Hope you like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Banneker, lifting his glass in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grove Street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cressey knit his brows. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that? Harlem?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Over west of Sixth Avenue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer kind of place to live, ain&rsquo;t it? There&rsquo;s a corkin&rsquo;
      little suite vacant over at the Regalton. Cheap at the money.
      Oh!-er-I-er-maybe&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; smiled Banneker. &ldquo;The treasury
      isn&rsquo;t up to bachelor suites, yet awhile. I&rsquo;ve only just got a
      job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newspaper work. The Morning Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reporting?&rdquo; A dubious expression clouded the candid
      cheerfulness of the other&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; I dunno. It&rsquo;s a piffling sort of job, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piffling? How do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I supposed you had to ask a lot of questions and pry into
      other people&rsquo;s business and&mdash;and all that sorta thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If nobody asked questions,&rdquo; pointed out Banneker, remembering
      Gardner&rsquo;s resolute devotion to his professional ideals, &ldquo;there
      wouldn&rsquo;t be any news, would there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the gilded youth. &ldquo;The
      Ledger&rsquo;s the decentest paper in town, too. It&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s
      paper. I know a feller on it; Guy Mallory; was in my class at college.
      Give you a letter to him if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that Banneker already knew Mr. Mallory, his host expressed the
      hope of being useful to him in any other possible manner&mdash;&ldquo;any
      tips I can give you or anything of that sort, old chap?&rdquo;&mdash;so
      heartily that the newcomer broached the subject of clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; easier,&rdquo; was the ready response. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      take you right down to Mertoun. Just one more and we&rsquo;re off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The one more having been disposed of: &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo;
      inquired Cressey, when they were settled in the taxi which was waiting at
      the club door for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what <i>do</i> I want? You tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far do you want to go? Will five hundred be too much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cressey lost himself in mental calculations out of which he presently
      delivered himself to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening clothes, of course. And a dinner-jacket suit. Two business
      suits, a light and a dark. You won&rsquo;t need a morning coat, I expect,
      for a while. Anyway, we&rsquo;ve got to save somethin&rsquo; out for
      shirts and boots, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the money with me&rdquo; remarked Banneker, his
      innocent mind on the cash-with-order policy of Sears-Roebuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; said Cressey, good-humoredly, yet with an
      effect of authority. &ldquo;This is a game that&rsquo;s got to be played
      according to the rules. Why, if you put down spot cash before Mertoun&rsquo;s
      eyes he&rsquo;d faint from surprise, and when he came to, he&rsquo;d have
      no respect for you. And a tailor&rsquo;s respect for you,&rdquo; continued
      Cressey, the sage, &ldquo;shows in your togs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do I pay, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in three or four months he sends around a bill. That&rsquo;s
      more of a reminder to come in and order your fall outfit than it is
      anything else. But you can send him a check on account, if you feel like
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A check?&rdquo; repeated the neophyte blankly. &ldquo;Must I have a
      bank account?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safer than a sock, my boy. And just as simple. To-morrow will do
      for that, when we call on the shirt-makers and the shoe sharps. I&rsquo;ll
      put you in my bank; they&rsquo;ll take you on for five hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Mertoun&rsquo;s, Banneker unobtrusively but positively
      developed a taste of his own in the matter of hue and pattern; one, too,
      which commanded Cressey&rsquo;s respect. The gilded youth&rsquo;s judgment
      tended toward the more pronounced herringbones and homespuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right for you, who can change seven days in the week; but I&rsquo;ve
      got to live with these clothes, day in and day out,&rdquo; argued
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Cressey deferred, though with a sigh. &ldquo;You could carry off
      those sporty things as if they were woven to order for you,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the figure, the carriage, the&mdash;the
      whatever-the-devil it is, for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prospectively poorer by something more than four hundred dollars, Banneker
      emerged from Mertoun&rsquo;s with his mentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gotta get home and dress for a rotten dinner,&rdquo; announced that
      gentleman cheerfully. &ldquo;Duck in here with me,&rdquo; he invited,
      indicating a sumptuous bar, near the tailor&rsquo;s, &ldquo;and get
      another little kick in the stomach. No? Oh, verrawell. Where are you for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Public Library.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; said his companion, honestly shocked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a gloomy hole, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so bad, when you get used to it. I&rsquo;ve been putting in
      three hours a day there lately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, browsing. Book-hungry, I suppose. Carnegie hasn&rsquo;t
      discovered Manzanita yet, you know; so I haven&rsquo;t had many library
      opportunities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Manzanita,&rdquo; remarked Cressey, and spoke of it,
      reminiscently and at length, as they walked along together. &ldquo;Did the
      lovely and mysterious I.O.W. ever turn up and report herself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s breath caught painfully in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know who she was?&rdquo; pursued the other, without
      pause for reply to his previous question; and still without intermission
      continued: &ldquo;Io Welland. <i>That</i>&rsquo;s who she was. Oh, but she&rsquo;s
      a hummer! I&rsquo;ve met her since. Married, you know. Quick work, that
      marriage. There was a dam&rsquo; queer story whispered around about her
      starting to elope with some other chap, and his going nearly batty because
      she didn&rsquo;t turn up, and all the time she was wandering around in the
      desert until somebody picked her up and took care of her. You ought to
      know something of that. It was supposed to be right in your back-yard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Banneker, commanding himself with an effort; &ldquo;Miss
      Welland reported in with a slight injury. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance at him told Cressey that Banneker did indeed &ldquo;know
      something&rdquo; of the mysterious disappearance which had so exercised a
      legion of busy tongues in New York; how much that something might be, he
      preserved for future and private speculation, based on the astounding
      perception that Banneker was in real pain of soul. Tact inspired Cressey
      to say at once: &ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s all you had to consider. By
      the way, you haven&rsquo;t seen my revered uncle since you got here, have
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vanney? No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better drop in on him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might try to give me another yellow-back,&rdquo; smiled the
      ex-agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take Uncle Van for a fool. Once is plenty for him to be
      hit on the nose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he still got a green whisker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see. He&rsquo;s asked about you two or three times in the
      last coupla months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no errand with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell? He might start something for you. It isn&rsquo;t
      often that he keeps a man in mind like he has you. Anyway, he&rsquo;s a
      wise old bird and may hand you a pointer or two about what&rsquo;s what in
      New York. Shall I phone him you&rsquo;re in town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll get in to see him some time to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made an appointment, in the vital matter of shirts and shoes, for
      the morning, they parted. Banneker set to his browsing in the library
      until hunger drove him forth. After dinner he returned to his room,
      cumbered with the accumulation of evening papers, for study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the thin partition he could hear Miss Westlake moving about and
      humming happily to herself. The sound struck dismay to his soul. The
      prospect of work from him was doubtless the insecure foundation of that
      cheerfulness. &ldquo;Soon&rdquo; he had said; the implication was that the
      matter was pressing. Probably she was counting on it for the morrow. Well,
      he must furnish something, anything, to feed the maw of her hungry
      typewriter; to fulfill that wistful hope which had sprung in her eyes when
      he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweeping his table bare of the lore and lure of journalism as typified in
      the bulky, black-faced editions, he set out clean paper, cleansed his
      fountain pen, and stared at the ceiling. What should he write about? His
      mental retina teemed with impressions. But they were confused, unresolved,
      distorted for all that he knew, since he lacked experience and knowledge
      of the environment, and therefore perspective. Groping, he recalled a
      saying of Gardner&rsquo;s as that wearied enthusiast descanted upon the
      glories of past great names in metropolitan journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to say of Julian Ralph that he was always discovering
      City Hall Park and getting excited over it; and when he got excited
      enough, he wrote about it so that the public just ate it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he, Banneker, hadn&rsquo;t discovered City Hall Park; not
      consciously. But he had gleaned wonder and delight from other and more
      remote spots, and now one of them began to stand forth upon the blank
      ceiling at which he stared, seeking guidance. A crowded corner of Essex
      Street, stewing in the hard sunshine. The teeming, shrill crowd. The
      stench and gleam of a fish-stall offering bargains. The eager games of the
      children, snatched between onsets of imminent peril as cart or truck came
      whirling through and scattering the players. Finally the episode of the
      trade fracas over the remains of a small and dubious weakfish, terminating
      when the dissatisfied customer cast the delicacy at the head of the
      stall-man and missed him, the <i>corpus delicti</i> falling into the
      gutter where it was at once appropriated and rapt away by an incredulous,
      delighted, and mangy cat. A crude, commonplace, malodorous little street
      row, the sort of thing that happens, in varying phases, on a dozen
      East-Side corners seven days in the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker approached and treated the matter from the viewpoint of the cat,
      predatory, philosophic, ecstatic. One o&rsquo;clock in the morning saw the
      final revision, for he had become enthralled with the handling of his
      subject. It was only a scant five pages; less than a thousand words. But
      as he wrote and rewrote, other schemata rose to the surface of his
      consciousness, and he made brief notes of them on random ends of paper;
      half a dozen of them, one crowding upon another. Some day, perhaps, when
      there were enough of them, when he had become known, had achieved the
      distinction of a signature like Gardner, there might be a real series....
      His vague expectancies were dimmed in weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the genesis of the &ldquo;Local Vagrancies&rdquo; which later
      were to set Park Row speculating upon the signature &ldquo;Eban.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accessibility was one of Mr. Horace Vanney&rsquo;s fads. He aspired to be
      a publicist, while sharing fallible humanity&rsquo;s ignorance of just
      what the vague and imposing term signifies; and, as a publicist, he
      conceived it in character to be readily available to the public. Almost
      anybody could get to see Mr. Vanney in his tasteful and dignified lower
      Broadway offices, upon almost any reasonable or plausible errand.
      Especially was he hospitable to the newspaper world, the agents of
      publicity; and, such is the ingratitude of the fallen soul of man, every
      newspaper office in the city fully comprehended his attitude, made use of
      him as convenient, and professionally regarded him as a bit of a joke,
      albeit a useful and amiable joke. Of this he had no inkling. Enough for
      him that he was frequently, even habitually quoted, upon a wide range of
      windy topics, often with his picture appended.
    </p>
    <p>
      With far less difficulty than he had found in winning the notice of Mr.
      Gordon, Banneker attained the sanctum of the capitalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; was the important man&rsquo;s greeting as he
      shook hands. &ldquo;Our young friend from the desert! How do we find New
      York?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From Banneker&rsquo;s reply, there grew out a pleasantly purposeless
      conversation, which afforded the newcomer opportunity to decide that he
      did not like this Mr. Vanney, sleek, smiling, gentle, and courteous, as
      well as he had the brusque old tyrant of the wreck. That green-whiskered
      autocrat had been at least natural, direct, and unselfish in his grim
      emergency work. This manifestation seemed wary, cautious, on its guard to
      defend itself against some probable tax upon its good nature. All this
      unconscious, instinctive reckoning of the other man&rsquo;s
      characteristics gave to the young fellow an effect of poise, of judicious
      balance and quiet confidence. It was one of Banneker&rsquo;s elements of
      strength, which subsequently won for him his unique place, that he was
      always too much interested in estimating the man to whom he was talking,
      to consider even what the other might think of him. It was at once a form
      of egoism, and the total negation of egotism. It made him the least
      self-conscious of human beings. And old Horace Vanney, pompous, vain, the
      most self-conscious of his genus, felt, though he could not analyze, the
      charm of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chance word indicated that Banneker was already &ldquo;placed.&rdquo; At
      once, though almost insensibly, the attitude of Mr. Vanney eased;
      obviously there was no fear of his being &ldquo;boned&rdquo; for a job. At
      the same time he experienced a mild misgiving lest he might be forfeiting
      the services of one who could be really useful to him. Banneker&rsquo;s
      energy and decisiveness at the wreck had made a definite impression upon
      him. But there was the matter of the rejected hundred-dollar tip.
      Unpliant, evidently, this young fellow. Probably it was just as well that
      he should be broken in to life and new standards elsewhere than in the
      Vanney interests. Later, if he developed, watchfulness might show it to be
      worth while to....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you have in mind, my boy?&rdquo; inquired the
      benign Mr. Vanney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I start in on The Ledger next month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ledger! Indeed! I did not know that you had any journalistic
      experience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. Er&mdash;hum! Journalism, eh? A&mdash;er&mdash;brilliant
      profession!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think well of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have many friends among the journalists. Fine fellows! Very fine
      fellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinctive tone of patronage was not lost upon Banneker. He felt
      annoyed at Mr. Vanney. Unreasonably annoyed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with journalism?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter?&rdquo; Mr. Vanney was blandly surprised. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
      I just said&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you have. Would you let your son go into a newspaper office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son? My son chose the profession of law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he had wanted to be a journalist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalism does not perhaps offer the same opportunities for
      personal advancement as some other lines,&rdquo; said the financier
      cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is largely anonymous.&rdquo; Mr. Vanney gave the impression of
      feeling carefully for his words. &ldquo;One may go far in journalism and
      yet be comparatively unknown to the public. Still, he might be of great
      usefulness,&rdquo; added the sage, brightening, &ldquo;very great
      usefulness. A sound, conservative, self-respecting newspaper such as The
      Ledger, is a public benefactor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the editor of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my boy,&rdquo; approved the other. &ldquo;Aim
      high! Aim high! The great prizes in journalism are few. They are, in any
      line of endeavor. And the apprenticeship is hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Cressey&rsquo;s clumsy but involuntary protest reasserted itself
      in Banneker&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I wish you would tell me frankly, Mr.
      Vanney, whether reporting is considered undignified and that sort of
      thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reporters can be a nuisance,&rdquo; replied Mr. Vanney fervently.
      &ldquo;But they can also be very useful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on the whole&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole it is a necessary apprenticeship. Very suitable for a
      young man. Not a final career, in my judgment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter on The Ledger, then, is nothing but a reporter on The
      Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough, for a start?&rdquo; smiled the other.
      &ldquo;The station-agent at&mdash;what was the name of your station? Yes,
      Manzanita. The station-agent at Manzanita&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was E. Banneker,&rdquo; interposed the owner of that name
      positively. &ldquo;A small puddle, but the inhabitant was an individual
      toad, at least. To keep one&rsquo;s individuality in New York isn&rsquo;t
      so easy, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are quite a number of people in New York,&rdquo; pointed out
      the philosopher, Vanney. &ldquo;Mostly crowd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me something
      about the newspaper business that I wanted to know.&rdquo; He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other put out an arresting hand. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to do
      a little reporting for me, before you take up your regular work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of reporting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite simple. A manufacturing concern in which I own a considerable
      interest has a strike on its hands. Suppose you go down to Sippiac, New
      Jersey, where our factories are, spend three or four days, and report back
      to me your impressions and any ideas you may gather as to improving our
      organization for furthering our interests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that I could be useful in that line?&rdquo;
      asked Banneker curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My observations at the Manzanita wreck. You have, I believe, a
      knack for handling a situation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can always try,&rdquo; accepted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supplied with letters to the officials of the International Cloth Company,
      and a liberal sum for expenses, the neophyte went to Sippiac. There he
      visited the strongly guarded mills, still making a feeble pretense of
      operating, talked with the harassed officials, the gang-boss of the
      strike-breakers, the &ldquo;private guards,&rdquo; who had, in fact,
      practically assumed dominant police authority in the place; all of which
      was faithful to the programme arranged by Mr. Vanney. Having done so much,
      he undertook to obtain a view of the strike from the other side; visited
      the wretched tenements of the laborers, sought out the sullen and
      distrustful strike-leaders, heard much fiery oratory and some veiled
      threats from impassioned agitators, mostly foreign and all tragically
      earnest; chatted with corner grocerymen, saloon-keepers, ward politicians,
      composing his mental picture of a strike in a minor city, absolutely
      controlled, industrially, politically, and socially by the industry which
      had made it. The town, as he came to conceive it, was a fevered and
      struggling gnome, bound to a wheel which ground for others; a gnome who,
      if he broke his bonds, would be perhaps only the worse for his freedom. At
      the beginning of the sixth day, for his stay had outgrown its original
      plan, the pocket-ledger, 3 T 9901, was but little the richer, but the mind
      of its owner teemed with impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his purpose to take those impressions in person to Mr. Horace
      Vanney, by the 10 A.M. train. Arriving at the station early, he was
      surprised at being held up momentarily by a line of guards engaged in
      blocking off a mob of wailing, jabbering women, many of whom had children
      in their arms, or at their skirts. He asked the ticket-agent, a big, pasty
      young man about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mill workers,&rdquo; said the agent, making change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they after?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanta get to the 10.10 train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the guards are stopping them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can use your eyes, cantcha?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Using his eyes, Banneker considered the position. &ldquo;Are those fellows
      on railroad property?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to you whether they are or ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker explained his former occupation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo;
      said the agent. &ldquo;Come inside. That&rsquo;s a hell of a mess, ain&rsquo;t
      it!&rdquo; he added plaintively as Banneker complied. &ldquo;Some of those
      poor Hunkies have got their tickets and can&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d see that they got their train, if this was my station,&rdquo;
      asserted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you would! With that gang of strong-arms against you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chase &rsquo;em,&rdquo; advised Banneker simply. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      got no right keeping your passengers off your trains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chase &rsquo;em, ay? You&rsquo;d do it, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a gun, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you think those guys haven&rsquo;t got guns, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say is, that if there had been passengers held up
      from their trains at my station and I didn&rsquo;t get them through, <i>I</i>&rsquo;d
      have been through so far as the Atkinson and St. Philip goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This railroad&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;d be through if I butted
      in on this mill row.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for one thing, old Vanney, who&rsquo;s the real boss here, is
      a director of the road.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So <i>that</i>&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Banneker digested this
      information. &ldquo;Why are the women so anxious to get away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say&rdquo;&mdash;the local agent lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;their
      children are starving here, and they can get better jobs in other places.
      Naturally the mills don&rsquo;t want to lose a lot of their hands,
      particularly the women, because they&rsquo;re the cheapest. I don&rsquo;t
      know as I blame &rsquo;em for that. But this business of hiring a bunch of
      ex-cons and&mdash;Hey! Where are you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was beyond the door before the query was completed. Looking out
      of the window, the agent saw a fat and fussy young mother, who had
      contrived to get through the line, waddling at her best speed across the
      open toward the station, and dragging a small boy by the hand. A lank
      giant from the guards&rsquo; ranks was after her. Screaming, she turned
      the corner out of his vision. There were sounds which suggested a row at
      the station-door, but the agent, called at that moment to the wire, could
      not investigate. The train came and went, and he saw nothing more of the
      ex-railroader from the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr. Horace Vanney smiled pleasantly enough when Banneker
      presented himself at the office to make his report, the nature of the
      smile suggested a background more uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you found, my boy?&rdquo; the financier began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many things that ought to be changed,&rdquo; answered
      Banneker bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite probably. No institution is perfect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mills are pretty rotten. You pay your people too little&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you get that idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the way they live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy; if we paid them twice as much, they&rsquo;d live the
      same way. The surplus would go to the saloons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not wipe out the saloons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the Common Council of Sippiac,&rdquo; returned Mr. Vanney
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; retorted Banneker even more dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other frowned. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; the housing. You own a good many of the tenements, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The company owns some.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re filthy holes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are what the tenants make them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tenants didn&rsquo;t build them with lightless hallways, did
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t live there if they don&rsquo;t like them. Have
      you spent all your time, for which I am paying, nosing about like a cheap
      magazine muckraker?&rdquo; It was clear that Mr. Vanney was annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to find out what is wrong with Sippiac. I
      thought you wanted facts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Facts. Not sentimental gushings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are your guards. There isn&rsquo;t much sentiment about
      them. I saw one of them smash a woman in the face, and knock her down,
      while she was trying to catch a train and get out of town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how much. But I hope enough to land him
      in the hospital. They pulled me off too soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you would have been killed if it hadn&rsquo;t been
      for some of the factory staff who saved you from the other guards&mdash;as
      you deserved, for your foolhardiness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s eyebrows went up a bit. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bank too
      much on my foolhardiness. I had a wall back of me. And there would have
      been material for several funerals before they got me.&rdquo; He touched
      his hip-pocket. &ldquo;By the way, you seem to be well informed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in &lsquo;phone communication with Sippiac since
      the regrettable occurrence. It perhaps didn&rsquo;t occur to you to find
      out that the woman, who is now under arrest, bit the guard very severely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! Just like the rabbit bit the bulldog. You&rsquo;ve got a
      lot of thugs and strong-arm men doing your dirty work, that ought to be in
      jail. If the newspapers here ever get onto the situation, it would make
      pretty rough reading for you, Mr. Vanney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnate looked at him with contemptuous amusement. &ldquo;No newspaper
      of decent standing prints that kind of socialistic stuff, my young friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not! Because of my position. Because the International Cloth
      Company is a powerful institution of the most reputable standing, with
      many lines of influence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is enough to keep the newspapers from printing an article
      about conditions in Sippiac?&rdquo; asked Banneker, deeply interested in
      this phase of the question. &ldquo;Is that the fact?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the fact; The Sphere, for one, would have handled the strike on
      the basis of news interest, as Mr. Vanney well knew; wherefore he hated
      and pretended to despise The Sphere. But for his own purposes he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a paper in New York would touch it. Except,&rdquo; he added
      negligently, &ldquo;perhaps some lying, Socialist sheet. And let me warn
      you, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; he pursued in his suavest tone, &ldquo;that you
      will find no place for your peculiar ideas on The Ledger. In fact, I doubt
      whether you will be doing well either by them or by yourself in going on
      their staff, holding such views as you do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? Then I&rsquo;ll tell them beforehand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vanney privately reflected that there was no need of this: <i>he</i>
      intended to call up the editor-in-chief and suggest the unsuitability of
      the candidate for a place, however humble, on the staff of a highly
      respectable and suitably respectful daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which he did. The message was passed on to Mr. Gordon, and, in his large
      and tolerant soul, decently interred. One thing of which the managing
      editor of The Ledger was not tolerant was interference from without in his
      department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before allowing his man to leave, Mr. Vanney read him a long and
      well-meant homily, full of warning and wisdom, and was both annoyed and
      disheartened when, at the end of it, Banneker remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dare you to take a car and spend twenty-four hours going
      about Sippiac with me. If you stand for your system after that, I&rsquo;ll
      pay for the car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the other replied sadly that Banneker had in some manner acquired
      a false and distorted view of industrial relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therein, for once in an existence guided almost exclusively by prejudice,
      Horace Vanney was right. At the outset of a new career to which he was
      attuning his mind, Banneker had been injected into a situation typical of
      all that is worst in American industrial life, a local manufacturing
      enterprise grown rich upon the labor of underpaid foreigners, through the
      practice of all the vicious, lawless, and insidious methods of an ingrown
      autocracy, and had believed it to be fairly representative. Had not Horace
      Vanney, doubtless genuine in his belief, told him as much?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as fair and careful with our employees as any of our
      competitors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact there were, even then, scores of manufacturing plants
      within easy distance of New York, representing broad and generous policies
      and conducted on a progressive and humanistic labor system. Had Banneker
      had his first insight into local industrial conditions through one of
      these, he might readily have been prejudiced in favor of capital. As it
      was, swallowing Vanney&rsquo;s statement as true, he mistook an evil
      example as a fair indication of the general status. Then and there he
      became a zealous protagonist of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Mr. Horace Vanney&rsquo;s shrewd design to show a budding
      journalist of promise on which side his self-interest lay. The weak spot
      in the plan was that Banneker did not seem to care!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s induction into journalism was unimpressive. They gave him
      a desk, an outfit of writing materials, a mail-box with his name on it,
      and eventually an assignment. Mr. Mallory presented him to several of the
      other &ldquo;cubs&rdquo; and two or three of the older and more important
      reporters. They were all quite amiable, obviously willing to be helpful,
      and they impressed the observant neophyte with that quiet and solid <i>esprit
      de corps</i> which is based upon respect for work well performed in a
      common cause. He apprehended that The Ledger office was in some sort an
      institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of his new acquaintances volunteered information as to the mechanism
      of his new job. Apparently he was expected to figure that out for himself.
      By nature reticent, and trained in an environment which still retained
      enough of frontier etiquette to make a scrupulous incuriosity the
      touchstone of good manners and perhaps the essence of self-preservation,
      Banneker asked no questions. He sat and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the other reporters were summoned by name to the city desk, and
      dispatched with a few brief words upon the various items of the news.
      Presently Banneker found himself alone, in the long files of desks. For an
      hour he sat there and for a second hour. It seemed a curious way in which
      to be earning fifteen dollars a week. He wondered whether he was expected
      to sit tight at his desk. Or had he the freedom of the office?
      Characteristically choosing the more active assumption, he found his way
      to the current newspaper files. They were like old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker.&rdquo; An office boy was at his elbow. &ldquo;Mr.
      Greenough wants you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of a quickened pulse, and annoyed at himself because of it, the
      tyro advanced to receive his maiden assignment. The epochal event was
      embodied in the form of a small clipping from an evening paper, stating
      that a six-year-old boy had been fatally burned at a bonfire near the
      North River. Banneker, Mr. Greenough instructed him mildly, was to make
      inquiries of the police, of the boy&rsquo;s family, of the hospital, and
      of such witnesses as he could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick with interest he caught up his hat and hurried out. Death, in the
      sparsely populated country wherefrom he hailed, was a matter of inclusive
      local importance; he assumed the same of New York. Three intense hours he
      devoted to an item which any police reporter of six months&rsquo; standing
      would have rounded up in a brace of formal inquiries, and hastened back,
      brimful of details for Mr. Greenough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo; interpolated that blandly approving gentleman
      from time to time in the course of the narrative. &ldquo;Write it, Mr.
      Banneker! write it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much shall I write?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what is necessary to tell the news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the amiable smile which broadened without lighting up the
      sub-Mongol physiognomy of the city editor, Banneker suspected something.
      As he sat writing page after page, conscientiously setting forth every
      germane fact, the recollection of that speculative, estimating smile began
      to play over the sentences with a dire and blighting beam. Three fourths
      of the way through, the writer rose, went to the file-board and ran
      through a dozen newspapers. He was seeking a ratio, a perspective. He
      wished to determine how much, in a news sense, the death of the son of an
      obscure East-Side plasterer was worth. On his return he tore up all that
      he had written, and substituted a curt paragraph, without character or
      color, which he turned in. He had gauged the value of the tragedy
      accurately, in the light of his study of news files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenough showed the paragraph (which failed to appear at all in the
      overcrowded paper of next morning) to Mr. Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new man doesn&rsquo;t start well,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Too
      little imaginative interest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it knowledge rather than lack of interest?&rdquo;
      suggested the managing editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may come to the same thing. If he knows too much to get really
      interested, he&rsquo;ll be a dull reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether you&rsquo;ll find him dull,&rdquo; smiled Mr.
      Gordon. &ldquo;But he may find his job dull. In that case, of course he&rsquo;d
      better find another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, that was the danger which, for weeks to follow, Banneker skirted.
      Police news, petty and formal, made up his day&rsquo;s work. Had he sought
      beneath the surface of it the underlying elements, and striven to express
      these, his matter as it came to the desk, however slight the technical
      news value might have been, would have afforded the watchful copy-readers,
      trained to that special selectiveness as only The Ledger could train its
      men, opportunity of judging what potentialities might lurk beneath the
      crudities of the &ldquo;cub.&rdquo; But Banneker was not crude. He was
      careful. His sense of the relative importance of news, acquired by those
      weeks of intensive analysis before applying for his job, was too just to
      let him give free play to his pen. What was the use? The &ldquo;story&rdquo;
      wasn&rsquo;t worth the space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, 3 T 9901, which Banneker was already too cognoscent to
      employ in his formal newsgathering (the notebook is anathema to the
      metropolitan reporter), was filling up with odd bits, which were being
      transferred, in the weary hours when the new man sat at his desk with
      nothing to do, to paper in the form of sketches for Miss Westlake&rsquo;s
      trustful and waiting typewriter. Nobody could say that Banneker was not
      industrious. Among his fellow reporters he soon acquired the melancholy
      reputation of one who was forever writing &ldquo;special stuff,&rdquo;
      none of which ever &ldquo;landed.&rdquo; It was chiefly because of his
      industry and reliability, rather than any fulfillment of the earlier
      promise of brilliant worth as shown in the Sunday Sphere articles, that he
      got his first raise to twenty dollars. It surprised rather than gratified
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Mr. Gordon about it. The managing editor was the kind of man
      with whom it is easy to talk straight talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon played a thoughtful tattoo upon his fleshy knuckles with the
      letter-opener. &ldquo;Nothing. Aren&rsquo;t you satisfied?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your raise, and fairly early. Unless you had been
      worth it, you wouldn&rsquo;t have had it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I doing what you expected of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. But you&rsquo;re developing into a sure, reliable
      reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A routine man,&rdquo; commented Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, the routine man is the backbone of the office.&rdquo;
      Mr. Gordon executed a fantasia on his thumb. &ldquo;Would you care to try
      a desk job?&rdquo; he asked, peering at Banneker over his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather run a trolley car. There&rsquo;s more life in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you <i>see</i> life, in your work, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See it? I feel it. Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s going to flatten me
      out like a steam-roller.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not write it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t news: not what I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Perhaps it&rsquo;s something else. But if it&rsquo;s
      there and we can get a gleam of it into the paper, we&rsquo;ll crowd news
      out to make a place for it. You haven&rsquo;t been reading The Ledger I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a Bible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to good purpose, then. What do you think of Tommy Burt&rsquo;s
      stuff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny; some of it. But I couldn&rsquo;t do it to save my
      job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can do it but Burt, himself. Possibly you could learn
      something from it, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burt doesn&rsquo;t like it, himself. He told me it was all formula;
      that you could always get a laugh out of people about something they&rsquo;d
      been taught to consider funny, like a red nose or a smashed hat. He&rsquo;s
      got a list of Sign Posts on the Road to Humor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cynicism of twenty-eight,&rdquo; smiled the tolerant Mr.
      Gordon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself be inoculated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gordon,&rdquo; said Banneker doggedly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      doing the kind of work I expected to do here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly expect the star jobs until you&rsquo;ve made
      yourself a star man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker flushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complaining of the way I&rsquo;ve
      been treated. I&rsquo;ve had a square enough deal. The trouble is with me.
      I want to know whether I ought to stick or quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you quit, what would you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a notion,&rdquo; replied the other with an
      indifference which testified to a superb, instinctive self-confidence.
      &ldquo;Something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it here. I think you&rsquo;ll come along all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo; persisted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much restraint. A rare fault. You haven&rsquo;t let yourself
      out.&rdquo; For a space he drummed and mused. Suddenly a knuckle cracked
      loudly. Mr. Gordon flinched and glared at it, startled as if it had
      offended him by interrupting a train of thought. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said
      he brusquely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Sewer-Cleaners&rsquo; Association
      picnic to-morrow. They&rsquo;re going to put in half their day inspecting
      the Stimson Tunnel under the North River. Pretty idea; isn&rsquo;t it?
      Suppose I ask Mr. Greenough to send you out on the story. And I&rsquo;d
      like a look at it when you turn it in.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Banneker worked hard on his report of the picnic; hard and
      self-consciously. Tommy Burt would, he knew, have made a &ldquo;scream&rdquo;
      of it, for tired business men to chuckle over on their way downtown.
      Pursuant to what he believed Mr. Gordon wanted, Banneker strove
      conscientiously to be funny with these human moles, who, having twelve
      hours of freedom for sunshine and air, elected to spend half of it in a
      hole bigger, deeper, and more oppressive than any to which their noisome
      job called them. The result was five painfully mangled sheets which
      presently went to the floor, torn in strips. After that Banneker reported
      the picnic as he saw, felt, and smelt it. It was a somber bit of writing,
      not without its subtleties and shrewd perceptions; quite unsuitable to the
      columns of The Ledger, in which it failed to appear. But Mr. Gordon read
      it twice. He advised Banneker not to be discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was deeply discouraged. He wanted to resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he would nave resigned, if old Mynderse Verschoyle had not died at
      eight o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the day when Banneker was the
      earliest man to report at the office. A picturesque character, old
      Mynderse, who had lived for forty-five years with his childless wife in
      the ancient house on West 10th Street, and for the final fifteen years had
      not addressed so much as a word to her. She had died three months before;
      and now he had followed, apparently, from what Banneker learned in an
      interview with the upset and therefore voluble secretary of the dead man,
      because, having no hatred left on which to center his life, he had nothing
      else to live for. Banneker wrote the story of that hatred, rigid,
      ceremonious, cherished like a rare virtue until it filled two lives; and
      he threw about it the atmosphere of the drear and divided old house. At
      the end, the sound of the laughter of children at play in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article appeared word for word as he had written it. That noon Tommy
      Burt, the funny man, drawing down his hundred-plus a week on space, came
      over and sat on Banneker&rsquo;s desk, and swung his legs and looked at
      him mournfully and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve broken through your shell at last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it! My God, if I could write like that! But what&rsquo;s the
      use! Never in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; returned Banneker, pleased.
      &ldquo;Of course you can. But what&rsquo;s the rest of your &lsquo;if&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting my time here. The magazines for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on what you&rsquo;re after. For a man who wants to write,
      it&rsquo;s better, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gives him a larger audience. No newspaper story is remembered
      overnight except by newspaper men. And they don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they matter?&rdquo; Banneker was surprised again,
      this time rather disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little world. There isn&rsquo;t much substance to it.
      Take that Verschoyle stuff of yours; that&rsquo;s literature, that is! But
      you&rsquo;ll never hear of it again after next week. A few people here
      will remember it, and it&rsquo;ll help you to your next raise. But after
      you&rsquo;ve got that, and, after that, your lift onto space, where are
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The abruptly confidential approach of Tommy Burt flattered Banneker with
      the sense that by that one achievement of the Verschoyle story he had
      attained a new status in the office. Later there came out from the inner
      sanctum where sat the Big Chief, distilling venom and wit in equal parts
      for the editorial page, a special word of approval. But this pleased the
      recipient less than the praise of his peers in the city room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that first talk, Burt came back to Banneker&rsquo;s desk from time
      to time, and once took him to dinner at &ldquo;Katie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the
      little German restaurant around the corner. Burt was given over to a
      restless and inoffensively egoistic pessimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me. I&rsquo;m twenty-eight and making a good income. When I
      was twenty-three, I was making nearly as much. When I&rsquo;m
      thirty-eight, where shall I be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you keep on making it?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtful. A fellow goes stale on the kind of stuff I do. And if I
      do keep on? Five to six thousand is fine now. It won&rsquo;t be so much
      ten years from now. That&rsquo;s the hell of this game; there&rsquo;s no
      real chance in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the editing jobs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desk-work? Chain yourself by the leg, with a blue pencil in your
      hand to butcher better men&rsquo;s stuff? A managing editor, now, I&rsquo;ll
      grant you. He gets his twenty or twenty-five thousand if he doesn&rsquo;t
      die of overstrain, first. But there&rsquo;s only a few managing editors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more editorial writers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hired pens. Dishing up other fellows&rsquo; policies, whether you
      believe in em or not. No; I&rsquo;m not of that profession, anyway.&rdquo;
      He specified the profession, a highly ancient and dishonorable one. Mr.
      Burt, in his gray moods, was neither discriminating nor quite just.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker voiced the question which, at some point in his progress, every
      thoughtful follower of journalism must meet and solve as best he can.
      &ldquo;When a man goes on a newspaper I suppose he more or less accepts
      that paper&rsquo;s standards, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less? To what extent?&rdquo; countered the expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t figured that out, yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry about it,&rdquo; advised the other with a
      gleam of malice. &ldquo;The fellows that do figure it out to the end, and
      are honest enough about it, usually quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m not honest enough or perhaps I&rsquo;m too
      cowardly,&rdquo; retorted the gloomy Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker smiled. Though the other was nearly two years his senior, he felt
      immeasurably the elder. There is about the true reporter type an
      infinitely youthful quality; attractive and touching; the eternal
      juvenile, which, being once outgrown with its facile and evanescent
      enthusiasms, leaves the expert declining into the hack. Beside this
      prematurely weary example of a swift and precarious success, Banneker was
      mature of character and standard. Nevertheless, the seasoned journalist
      was steeped in knowledge which the tyro craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do,&rdquo; Banneker asked, &ldquo;if you were sent
      out to write a story absolutely opposed to something you believed right;
      political, for instance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write politics. That&rsquo;s a specialty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Parson&rsquo; Gale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he believe in everything The Ledger stands for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. In office hours. For and in consideration of one hundred
      and twenty-five dollars weekly, duly and regularly paid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside of office hours, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; that&rsquo;s different. In Harlem where he lives, the Parson is
      quite a figure among the reform Democrats. The Ledger, as you know, is
      Republican; and anything in the way of reform is its favorite butt. So
      Gale spends his working day poking fun at his political friends and
      associates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out West we&rsquo;d call that kind of fellow a yellow pup.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t call the Parson that; not to me,&rdquo; warned
      the other indignantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as square a man as you&rsquo;ll
      find on Park Row. Why, you were just saying, yourself, that a reporter is
      bound to accept his paper&rsquo;s standards when he takes the job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose the answer is that a man ought to work only on a
      newspaper in whose policies he believes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which policies? A newspaper has a hundred different ones about a
      hundred different things. Here in this office we&rsquo;re dead against the
      split infinitive and the Honest Laboring Man. We don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s
      honest and we&rsquo;ve got our grave doubts as to his laboring. Yet one of
      our editorial writers is an out-and-out Socialist and makes fiery speeches
      advising the proletariat to rise and grab the reins of government. But he&rsquo;d
      rather split his own head than an infinitive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he write anti-labor editorials?&rdquo; asked the bewildered
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as bad as that. He confines himself to European politics and
      popular scientific matters. But, of course, wherever there is necessity
      for an expression of opinion, he&rsquo;s anti-socialist in his writing, as
      he&rsquo;s bound to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment ago you were talking of hired pens. Now you seem to
      be defending that sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t understand your point of
      view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Neither do I, I guess,&rdquo; admitted the
      expositor with great candor. &ldquo;I can argue it either way and convince
      myself, so far as the other fellow&rsquo;s work is concerned. But not for
      my own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you figure it out for yourself, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I dodge. It&rsquo;s a kind of tacit arrangement
      between the desk and me. In minor matters I go with the paper. That&rsquo;s
      easy, because I agree with it in most questions of taste and the way of
      doing things. After all The Ledger <i>has</i> got certain standards of
      professional conduct and of decent manners; it&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s
      paper. The other things, the things where my beliefs conflict with the
      paper&rsquo;s standards, political or ethical, don&rsquo;t come my way.
      You see, I&rsquo;m a specialist; I do mostly the fluffy stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way to keep out of embarrassing decisions, I&rsquo;d
      like to become a specialist myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do it, all right,&rdquo; the other assured him earnestly.
      &ldquo;That story of yours shows it. You&rsquo;ve got The Ledger touch&mdash;no,
      it&rsquo;s more individual than that. But you&rsquo;ve got something that&rsquo;s
      going to stick out even here. Just the same, there&rsquo;ll come a time
      when you&rsquo;ll have to face the other issue of your job or your&mdash;well,
      your conscience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What Tommy Burt did not say in continuation, and had no need to say, since
      his expressive and ingenuous face said it for him, was, &ldquo;And I
      wonder what you&rsquo;ll do with <i>that</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A far more influential friend than Tommy Burt had been wondering, too, and
      had, not without difficulty, expressed her doubts in writing. Camilla Van
      Arsdale had written to Banneker:
    </p>
    <p>
      ... I know so little of journalism, but there are things about it that I
      distrust instinctively. Do you remember what that wrangler from the <i>Jon
      Cal</i> told Old Bill Speed when Bill wanted to hire him: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      take any job that I couldn&rsquo;t look in the eye and tell it to go to
      hell on five minutes&rsquo; notice.&rdquo; I have a notion that you&rsquo;ve
      got to take that attitude toward a reporting job. There must be so much
      that a man cannot do without loss of self-respect. Yet, I can&rsquo;t
      imagine why I should worry about you as to that. Unless it is that, in a
      strange environment one gets one&rsquo;s values confused.... Have you had
      to do any &ldquo;Society&rdquo; reporting yet? I hope not. The society
      reporters of my day were either obsequious little flunkeys and parasites,
      or women of good connections but no money who capitalized their
      acquaintanceship to make a poor living, and whom one was sorry for, but
      would rather not see. Going to places where one is not asked, scavenging
      for bits of news from butlers and housekeepers, sniffing after scandals&mdash;perhaps
      that is part of the necessary apprenticeship of newspaper work. But it&rsquo;s
      not a proper work for a gentleman. And, in any case, Ban, you are that, by
      the grace of your ancestral gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little enough did Banneker care for his ancestral gods: but he did greatly
      care for the maintenance of those standards which seemed to have grown,
      indigenously within him, since he had never consciously formulated them.
      As for reporting, of whatever kind, he deemed Miss Van Arsdale prejudiced.
      Furthermore, he had met the society reporter of The Ledger, an elderly,
      mild, inoffensive man, neat and industrious, and discerned in him no
      stigma of the lickspittle. Nevertheless, he hoped that he would not be
      assigned to such &ldquo;society news&rdquo; as Remington did not cover in
      his routine. It might, he conceived, lead him into false situations where
      he could be painfully snubbed. And he had never yet been in a position
      where any one could snub him without instant reprisals. In such
      circumstances he did not know exactly what he would do. However, that
      bridge could be crossed or refused when he came to it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Such members of the Brashear household as chose to accommodate themselves
      strictly to the hour could have eight o&rsquo;clock breakfast in the
      basement dining-room for the modest consideration of thirty cents;
      thirty-five with special cream-jug. At these gatherings, usually attended
      by half a dozen of the lodgers, matters of local interest were weightily
      discussed; such as the progress of the subway excavations, the
      establishment of a new Italian restaurant in 11th Street, or the calling
      away of the fourth-floor-rear by the death of an uncle who would perhaps
      leave him money. To this sedate assemblage descended one crisp December
      morning young Wickert, clad in the natty outline of a new Bernholz suit,
      and obviously swollen with tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whaddya know about the latest?&rdquo; he flung forth upon the
      coffee-scented air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The latest&rdquo; in young Wickert&rsquo;s compendium of speech
      might be the garments adorning his trim person, the current song-hit of a
      vaudeville to which he had recently contributed his critical attention, or
      some tidbit of purely local gossip. Hainer, the plump and elderly
      accountant, opined that Wickert had received an augmentation of salary,
      and got an austere frown for his sally. Evidently Wickert deemed his news
      to be of special import; he was quite bloated, conversationally. He now
      dallied with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when have you been taking in disguised millionaires, Mrs.
      Brashear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The presiding genius of the house, divided between professional resentment
      at even so remotely slurring an implication (for was not the Grove Street
      house good enough for any millionaire, undisguised!) and human curiosity,
      requested an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in Sherry&rsquo;s restaurant last night,&rdquo; said the
      offhand Wickert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t read about any fire there,&rdquo; said the jocose
      Hainer, pointing his sally with a wink at Lambert, the art-student.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wickert ignored the gibe. Such was the greatness of his tidings that he
      could afford to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our firm was giving a banquet to some buyers and big folks in the
      trade. Private room upstairs; music, flowers, champagne by the case. We do
      things in style when we do &rsquo;em. They sent me up after hours with an
      important message to our Mr. Webler; he was in charge of arrangements.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been promoted to be messenger, ay?&rdquo; put in Mr. Hainer,
      chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came downstairs,&rdquo; continued the other with only a
      venomous glance toward the seat of the scorner, &ldquo;I thought to myself
      what&rsquo;s the matter with taking a look at the swells feeding in the
      big restaurant. You may not know it, people, but Sherry&rsquo;s is the
      ree-churchiest place in Nuh Yawk to eat dinner. It&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em
      all beat. So I stopped at the door and took &rsquo;em in. Swell? Oh, you
      dolls! I stood there trying to work up the nerve to go in and siddown and
      order a plate of stew or something that wouldn&rsquo;t stick me more&rsquo;n
      a dollar, just to <i>say</i> I&rsquo;d been dining at Sherry&rsquo;s, when
      I looked across the room, and whadda you think?&rdquo; He paused, leaned
      forward, and shot out the climactic word, &ldquo;Banneker!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having his dinner there?&rdquo; asked the incredulous but
      fascinated Mrs. Brashear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like he owned the place. Table to himself, against the wall. Waiter
      fussin&rsquo; over him like he loved him. And dressed! Oh, Gee!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to him?&rdquo; asked Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke to me,&rdquo; answered Wickert, dealing in subtle
      distinctions. &ldquo;He was just finishing his coffee when I sighted him.
      Gave the waiter haffa dollar. I could see it on the plate. There I was at
      the door, and he said, &lsquo;Why, hello, Wickert. Come and have a liquor.&rsquo;
      He pronounced it a queer, Frenchy way. So I said thanks, I&rsquo;d have a
      highball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he seem surprised to see you there?&rdquo; asked
      Hainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wickert paid an unconscious tribute to good-breeding. &ldquo;Banneker&rsquo;s
      the kind of feller that wouldn&rsquo;t show it if he was surprised. He
      couldn&rsquo;t have been as surprised as I was, at that. We went to the
      bar and had a drink, and then I ast him what&rsquo;d <i>he</i>, have on <i>me</i>,
      and all the time I was sizing him up. I&rsquo;m telling you, he looked
      like he&rsquo;d grown up in Sherry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the conversation, it appeared from Mr. Wickert&rsquo;s
      spirited sketch, had consisted mainly in eager queries from himself, and
      good-humored replies by the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Banneker eat there every night?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no! He wasn&rsquo;t up to that much of a strain on his finances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the waiters seemed to know him, as if he was one of the regulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sense he was. Every Monday he dined there. Monday was his day off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Mr. Wickert (awed and groping) <i>would</i> be damned! All alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, smiling, admitted the solitude. He rather liked dining alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Wickert couldn&rsquo;t see that at all! Give him a pal and a coupla
      lively girls, say from the Ladies&rsquo; Tailor-Made Department,
      good-lookers and real dressers; that was <i>his</i> idea of a dinner,
      though he&rsquo;d never tried it at Sherry&rsquo;s. Not that he couldn&rsquo;t
      if he felt like it. How much did they stick you for a good feed-out with a
      cocktail and maybe a bottle of Italian Red?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course, that depended on which way was Wickert going? Could
      Banneker set him on his way? He was taking a taxi to the Avon Theater,
      where there was an opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Mr. Banneker (Wickert had by this time attained the &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
      stage) always follow up his dinner at Sherry&rsquo;s with a theater?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, if there were an opening. If not he went to the opera or a
      concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his part, Wickert liked a little more spice in life. Still, every
      feller to his tastes. And Mr. Banneker was sure dressed for the part. Say&mdash;if
      he didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;who made that full-dress suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      No; of course he didn&rsquo;t mind. Mertoun made it.

      After which Mr. Banneker had been deftly enshrouded in a fur-lined coat,
      worthy of a bank president, had crowned these glories with an impeccable
      silk hat, and had set forth. Wickert had only to add that he wore in his
      coat lapel one of those fancy tuberoses, which he, Wickert, had gone to
      the pains of pricing at the nearest flower shop immediately after leaving
      Banneker. A dollar apiece! No, he had not accepted the offer of a lift,
      being doubtful upon the point of honor as to whether he would be expected
      to pay a <i>pro rata</i> of the taxi charge. They, the assembled breakfast
      company, had his permission to call him, Mr. Wickert, a goat if Mr.
      Banneker wasn&rsquo;t the swellest-looking guy he had anywhere seen on
      that memorable evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody called Mr. Wickert a goat. But Mr. Hainer sniffed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And him a twenty-five-dollar-a-week reporter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has private means,&rdquo; suggested little Miss
      Westlake, who had her own reasons for suspecting this: reasons bolstered
      by many and frequent manuscripts, turned over to her for typing, recast,
      returned for retyping, and again, in many instances, re-recast and
      re-retyped, the result of the sweating process being advantageous to their
      literary quality. Simultaneous advantage had accrued to the typist, also,
      in a practical way. Though the total of her bills was modest, it
      constituted an important extra; and Miss Westlake no longer sought to find
      solace for her woes through the prescription of the ambulant school of
      philosophic thought, and to solve her dental difficulties by walking the
      floor of nights. Philosophy never yet cured a toothache. Happily the
      sufferer was now able to pay a dentist. Hence Banneker could work,
      untroubled of her painful footsteps in the adjoining room, and considered
      the outcome cheap at the price. He deemed himself an exponent of
      enlightened selfishness. Perhaps he was. But the dim and worn spinster
      would have given half a dozen of her best and painless teeth to be of
      service to him. Now she came to his defense with a pretty dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that Mr. Banneker would not be out of place in any
      company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; answered the cynical Lambert. &ldquo;But where
      does he get it? I ask you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever he gets it, no gentleman could be more forehanded in his
      obligations,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Brashear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he want to blow it for in a shirty place like
      Sherry&rsquo;s?&rdquo; marveled young Wickert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wyncha ask him?&rdquo; brutally demanded Hainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wickert examined his mind hastily, and was fain to admit inwardly that he
      had wanted to ask him, but somehow felt &ldquo;skittish&rdquo; about it.
      Outwardly he retorted, being displeased at his own weakness, &ldquo;Ask
      him yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had any one questioned the subject of the discussion at Mrs. Brashear&rsquo;s
      on this point, even if he were willing to reply to impertinent
      interrogations (a high improbability of which even the hardy Wickert seems
      to have had some timely premonition), he would perhaps have explained the
      glorified routine of his day-off, by saying that he went to Sherry&rsquo;s
      and the opening nights for the same reason that he prowled about the
      water-front and ate in polyglot restaurants on obscure street-corners east
      of Tompkins Square; to observe men and women and the manner of their
      lives. It would not have been a sufficient answer; Banneker must have
      admitted that to himself. Too much a man of the world in many strata not
      to be adjustable to any of them, nevertheless he felt more attuned to and
      at one with his environment amidst the suave formalism of Sherry&rsquo;s
      than in the more uneasy and precarious elegancies of an East-Side Tammany
      Association promenade and ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the youngsters of The Ledger said that he was climbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not climbing. To climb one must be conscious of an ascent to be
      surmounted. Banneker was serenely unaware of anything above him, in that
      sense. Eminent psychiatrists were, about that time, working upon the
      beginning of a theory of the soul, later to be imposed upon an
      impressionable and faddish world, which dealt with a profound psychical
      deficit known as a &ldquo;complex of inferiority.&rdquo; In Banneker they
      would have found sterile soil. He had no complex of inferiority, nor, for
      that matter, of superiority; mental attitudes which, applied to social
      status, breed respectively the toady and the snob. He had no complex at
      all. He had, or would have had, if the soul-analysts had invented such a
      thing, a simplex. Relative status was a matter to which he gave little
      thought. He maintained personal standards not because of what others might
      think of him, but because he chose to think well of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherry&rsquo;s and a fifth-row-center seat at opening nights meant to him
      something more than refreshment and amusement; they were an assertion of
      his right to certain things, a right of which, whether others recognized
      or ignored it, he felt absolutely assured. These were the readily
      attainable places where successful people resorted. Serenely determined
      upon success, he felt himself in place amidst the outward and visible
      symbols of it. Let the price be high for his modest means; this was an
      investment which he could not afford to defer. He was but anticipating his
      position a little, and in such wise that nobody could take exception to
      it, because his self-promotion demanded no aid or favor from any other
      living person. His interest was in the environment, not in the people, as
      such, who were hardly more than, &ldquo;walking ladies and gentlemen&rdquo;
      in a <i>mise-en-scène</i>. Indeed, where minor opportunities offered by
      chance of making acquaintances, he coolly rejected them. Banneker did not
      desire to know people&mdash;yet. When he should arrive at the point of
      knowing them, it must be upon his terms, not theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on one of his Monday evenings of splendor that a misadventure of
      the sort which he had long foreboded, befell him. Sherry&rsquo;s was
      crowded, and a few tables away Banneker caught sight of Herbert Cressey,
      dining with a mixed party of a dozen. Presently Cressey came over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing with yourself?&rdquo; he asked, shaking
      hands. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen you for months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working,&rdquo; replied Banneker. &ldquo;Sit down and have a
      cocktail. Two, Jules,&rdquo; he added to the attentive waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they can spare me for five minutes,&rdquo; agreed Cressey,
      glancing back at his forsaken place. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t what you call
      work, though, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. This is my day off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! And how goes the job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think so,&rdquo; commented the other, taking in the
      general effect of Banneker&rsquo;s easy habituation to the standards of
      the restaurant. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t own this place, do you?&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      From another member of the world which had inherited or captured Sherry&rsquo;s
      as part of the spoils of life, the question might have been offensive. But
      Banneker genuinely liked Cressey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he returned lightly. &ldquo;Do I give that
      unfortunate impression?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give very much the impression of owning old Jules&mdash;or he
      does&mdash;and having a proprietary share in the new head waiter. Are you
      here much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monday evenings, only.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a good cocktail,&rdquo; observed Cressey, savoring it
      expertly. &ldquo;Better than they serve to me. And, say, Banneker, did
      Mertoun make you that outfit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I quit him,&rdquo; declared the gilded youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Isn&rsquo;t it all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Dammit, it&rsquo;s a better job than ever I got out of
      him,&rdquo; returned his companion indignantly. &ldquo;Some change from
      the catalogue suit you sported when you landed here! You know how to wear
      &rsquo;em; I&rsquo;ve got to say that for you.... I&rsquo;ve got to get
      back. When&rsquo;ll you dine with me? I want to hear all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any Monday,&rdquo; answered Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cressey returned to his waiting potage, and was immediately bombarded with
      queries, mainly from the girl on his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the wonderful-looking foreigner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a foreigner. At least not very much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a North Italian princeling I used to know,&rdquo;
      said one of the women. &ldquo;One of that warm-complexioned out-of-door
      type, that preserves the Roman mould. Isn&rsquo;t he an Italian?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an American. I ran across him out in the desert country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence that burned-in brown. What was he doing out there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cressey hesitated. Innocent of any taint of snobbery himself, he yet did
      not know whether Banneker would care to have his humble position tacked
      onto the tails of that work of art, his new coat. &ldquo;He was in the
      railroad business,&rdquo; he returned cautiously. &ldquo;His name is
      Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing him for months,&rdquo; remarked another of
      the company. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always alone and always at that table.
      Nobody knows him. He&rsquo;s a mystery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beauty,&rdquo; said Cressey&rsquo;s left-hand
      neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Esther Forbes had been quite openly staring, with her large, gray,
      and childlike eyes, at Banneker, eating his oysters in peaceful
      unconsciousness of being made a subject for discussion. Miss Forbes was a
      Greuze portrait come to life and adjusted to the extremes of fashion.
      Behind an expression of the sweetest candor and wistfulness, as behind a
      safe bulwark, she preserved an effrontery which balked at no defiance of
      conventions in public, though essentially she was quite sufficiently
      discreet for self-preservation. Also she had a keen little brain, a
      reckless but good-humored heart and a memory retentive of important
      trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the West, Bertie?&rdquo; she inquired of Cressey. &ldquo;You
      were in that big wreck there, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil of a wreck,&rdquo; said Cressey uneasily. You never could
      tell what Esther might know or might not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him over here,&rdquo; directed that young lady blandly, &ldquo;for
      coffee and liqueurs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; protested one of the men. &ldquo;Nobody knows
      anything about him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo; put in Cressey, in a tone which
      ended that particular objection. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
      come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly there was a chorus of demand for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; yielded Cressey, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him next to me,&rdquo; directed Miss Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emissary visited Banneker&rsquo;s table, was observed to be in brief
      colloquy with him, and returned, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo; interrogated the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully sorry, but he says he isn&rsquo;t fit for decent
      human associations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More and more interesting!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What
      awful thing has he been doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eating onions,&rdquo; answered Cressey. &ldquo;Raw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; cried the indignant Miss Forbes.
      &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t eat raw onions at Sherry&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a
      subterfuge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I went over there myself, who&rsquo;ll bet a dozen silk
      stockings that I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off it, Ess,&rdquo; protested her brother-in-law across the
      table. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too high a jump, even for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She let herself be dissuaded, but her dovelike eyes were vagrant during
      the rest of the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasantly musing over the last glass of a good but moderate-priced
      Rosemont-Geneste, Banneker became aware of Cressey&rsquo;s dinner party
      filing past him: then of Jules, the waiter, discreetly murmuring
      something, from across the table. A faint and provocative scent came to
      his nostrils, and as he followed Jules&rsquo;s eyes he saw a feminine
      figure standing at his elbow. He rose promptly and looked down into a face
      which might have been modeled for a type of appealing innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Banneker, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Esther Forbes, and I think I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal
      about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem probable,&rdquo; he replied gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a cousin of mine,&rdquo; pursued the girl. &ldquo;She was Io
      Welland. Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A shock went through Banneker at the mention of the name. But he steadied
      himself to say: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herein he was speaking by the letter. Knowing Io Welland as he had, he
      deemed it very improbable that she had even so much as mentioned him to
      any of her friends. In that measure, at least, he believed, she would have
      respected the memory of the romance which she had so ruthlessly blasted.
      This girl, with the daring and wistful eyes, was simply fishing, so he
      guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His guess was correct. Mendacity was not outside of Miss Forbes&rsquo;s
      easy code when enlisted in a good cause, such as appeasing her own impish
      curiosity. Never had Io so much as mentioned that quaint and lively
      romance with which vague gossip had credited her, after her return from
      the West; Esther Forbes had gathered it in, gossamer thread by gossamer
      thread, and was now hoping to identify Banneker in its uncertain pattern.
      Her little plan of startling him into some betrayal had proven abortive.
      Not by so much as the quiver of a muscle or the minutest shifting of an
      eye had he given sign. Still convinced that he was the mysterious knight
      of the desert, she was moved to admiration for his self-command and to a
      sub-thrill of pleasurable fear as before an unknown and formidable
      species. The man who had transformed self-controlled and invincible Io
      Welland into the creature of moods and nerves and revulsions which she had
      been for the fortnight preceding her marriage, must be something out of
      the ordinary. Instinct of womankind told Miss Forbes that this and no
      other was the type of man to work such a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did know Io?&rdquo; she persisted, feeling, as she
      afterward confessed, that she was putting her head into the mouth of a
      lion concerning whose habits her knowledge was regrettably insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion did not bite her head off. He did not even roar. He merely said,
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a railroad wreck or something of that sort?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awfully bored and wishing I&rsquo;d go away and let you
      alone?&rdquo; she said, on a note that pleaded for forbearance. &ldquo;Because
      if you are, don&rsquo;t make such heroic efforts to conceal it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this an almost imperceptible twist at the corners of his lips
      manifested itself to the watchful eye and cheered the enterprising soul of
      Miss Forbes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said equably, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      interested to discover how far you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The snub left Miss Forbes unembarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as far as you&rsquo;ll let me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Did
      you ride in from your ranch and drag Io out of the tangled wreckage at the
      end of your lasso?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ranch? I wasn&rsquo;t on a ranch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; she smiled up at him like a beseeching angel,
      &ldquo;what did you do that kept us all talking and speculating about you
      for a whole week, though we didn&rsquo;t know your name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sat right on my job as station-agent at Manzanita and made up
      lists of the killed and injured,&rdquo; answered Banneker dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Station-agent!&rdquo; The girl was taken aback, for this was not at
      all in consonance with the Io myth as it had drifted back, from sources
      never determined, to New York. &ldquo;Were you the station-agent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bestowed a glance at once appraising and flattering, less upon himself
      than upon his apparel. &ldquo;And what are you now? President of the road?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter on The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; This seemed to astonish her even more than the
      previous information. &ldquo;What are you reporting here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off duty to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Could you get off duty some afternoon and come to tea, if I&rsquo;ll
      promise to have Io there to meet you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your party seems to be making signals of distress, Miss Forbes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the normal attitude of my friends and family toward
      me. You&rsquo;ll come, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you: but reporting keeps one rather too busy for amusement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she murmured, aggrieved. &ldquo;Then
      it <i>is</i> true about you and Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time she achieved a result. Banneker flushed angrily, though he said,
      coolly enough: &ldquo;I think perhaps you would make an enterprising
      reporter, yourself, Miss Forbes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should. Well, I&rsquo;ll apologize. And if you won&rsquo;t
      come for Io&mdash;she&rsquo;s still abroad, by the way and won&rsquo;t be
      back for a month&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ll come for me. Just to show that
      you forgive my impertinences. Everybody does. I&rsquo;m going to tell
      Bertie Cressey he must bring you.... All right, Bertie! I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t
      follow me up like&mdash;like a paper-chase. Good-night, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To her indignant escort she declared that it couldn&rsquo;t have hurt them
      to wait a jiffy; that she had had a most amusing conversation; that Mr.
      Banneker was as charming as he was good to look at; and that (in answer to
      sundry questions) she had found out little or nothing, though she hoped
      for better results in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s Io&rsquo;s passion-in-the-desert right enough,&rdquo;
      said the irreverent Miss Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sat long over his cooling coffee. Through haunted nights he had
      fought maddening memories of Io&rsquo;s shadowed eyes, of the exhalant,
      irresistible femininity of her, of the pulses of her heart against his on
      that wild and wonderful night in the flood; and he had won to an armed
      peace, in which the outposts of his spirit were ever on guard against the
      recurrent thoughts of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at the bitter music of her name on the lips of a gossiping and
      frivolous girl, the barriers had given away. In eagerness and
      self-contempt he surrendered to the vision. Go to an afternoon tea to see
      and speak with her again? He would, in that awakened mood, have walked
      across the continent, only to be in her presence, to feel himself once
      more within the radius of that inexorable charm.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katie&rsquo;s&rdquo; sits, sedate and serviceable, on a narrow side
      street so near to Park Row that the big table in the rear rattles its
      dishes when the presses begin their seismic rumblings, in the daily effort
      to shake the world. Here gather the pick and choice of New York
      journalism, while still on duty, to eat and drink and discuss the inner
      news of things which is so often much more significant than the published
      version; haply to win or lose a few swiftly earned dollars at pass-three
      hearts. It is the unofficial press club of Newspaper Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said McHale of The Sphere, who, having been stuck with the queen of spades&mdash;that
      most unlucky thirteener&mdash;twice in succession, was retiring on his
      losses, to Mallory of The Ledger who had just come in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve got a sucking genius at your shop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Banneker, he&rsquo;s weaned,&rdquo; replied the
      assistant city editor of The Ledger. &ldquo;He goes on space next week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he, though! Quick work, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A record for the office. He&rsquo;s been on the staff less than a
      year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he really such a wonder?&rdquo; asked Glidden of The Monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four Ledger men answered at once, citing various stories which
      had stirred the interest of Park Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you Ledger fellows are always giving the college yell for each
      other,&rdquo; said McHale, impatiently voicing the local jealousy of The
      Ledger&rsquo;s recognized <i>esprit de corps</i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
      bigger rockets than him come down in the ash-heap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; prophesied Tommy Burt, The Ledger&rsquo;s
      humorous specialist. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go up and stay up. High! He&rsquo;s
      got the stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; observed Fowler, the star man of The Patriot,
      &ldquo;he covers his assignment in taxicabs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets the news,&rdquo; murmured Mallory, summing up in that
      phrase all the encomiums which go to the perfect praise of the
      natural-born reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he writes it,&rdquo; put in Van Cleve of The Courier. &ldquo;Lord,
      how that boy can write! Why, a Banneker two-sticks stands out as if it
      were printed in black-face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him around,&rdquo; remarked Glidden. &ldquo;What
      does he do with himself besides work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I imagine,&rdquo; answered Mallory. &ldquo;One of the cubs
      reports finding him at the Public Library, before ten o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, surrounded by books on journalism. He&rsquo;s a serious young
      owl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t get into his copy, then,&rdquo; asserted &ldquo;Parson&rdquo;
      Gale, political expert for The Ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor into his appearance. He certainly dresses like a flower of the
      field. Even the wrinkles in his clothes have the touch of high-priced
      Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be rich,&rdquo; surmised Fowler. &ldquo;Taxis for assignments
      and Fifth-Avenue raiment sound like real money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows where he got it, then,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt. &ldquo;Used
      to be a freight brakeman or something out in the wild-and-woolly. When he
      arrived, he was dressed very proud and stiff like a Baptist elder going to
      make a social call, all but the made-up bow tie and the oil on the hair.
      Some change and sudden!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a touch of the swelled head, though, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
      asked Van Cleve. &ldquo;I hear he&rsquo;s beginning to pick his
      assignments already. Refuses to take society stuff and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mallory, &ldquo;I suppose that comes from his being
      assigned to a tea given by the Thatcher Forbes for some foreign celebrity,
      and asking to be let off because he&rsquo;d already been invited there and
      declined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed McHale. &ldquo;Where does our young bird
      come in to fly as high as the Thatcher Forbes? He may look like a million
      dollars, but is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt, &ldquo;is that every Monday,
      which is his day off, he dines at Sherry&rsquo;s, and goes in lonely glory
      to a first-night, if there is one, afterward. It must have been costing
      him half of his week&rsquo;s salary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swelled head, sure,&rdquo; diagnosed Decker, the financial reporter
      of The Ledger. &ldquo;Well, watch the great Chinese joss, Greenough, pull
      the props from under him when the time comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As how?&rdquo; inquired Glidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By handing him a nawsty one out of the assignment book, just to
      show him where his hat fits too tight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A run of four-line obits,&rdquo; suggested Van Cleve, who had
      passed a painful apprenticeship of death-notices in which is neither
      profitable space nor hopeful opportunity, &ldquo;for a few days, will do
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the job of asking an indignant millionaire papa why his pet
      daughter ran away with the second footman and where.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or interviewing old frozen-faced Willis Enderby on his political
      intentions, honorable or dishonorable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I know Banneker,&rdquo; said Mallory, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s game. He&rsquo;ll
      take what&rsquo;s handed him and put it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, maybe,&rdquo; contributed Tommy Burt. &ldquo;Twice, perhaps.
      But I wouldn&rsquo;t want to crowd too much on him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greenough won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s wise in the ways of marvelous and
      unlicked cubs,&rdquo; said Decker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What do you think Banneker would do?&rdquo; asked Mallory
      curiously, addressing Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he got an assignment too rich for his stomach? Well, speaking
      unofficially and without special knowledge, I&rsquo;d guess that he&rsquo;d
      handle it to a finish, and then take his very smart and up-to-date hat and
      perform a polite adieu to Mr. Greenough and all the works of The Ledger
      city room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin, gray, somnolent elder at the end of the table, whose nobly cut
      face was seared with lines of physical pain endured and outlived, withdrew
      a very small pipe from his mouth and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Venerable Russell Edmonds has the floor,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt
      in a voice whose open raillery subtly suggested an underlying affection
      and respect. &ldquo;He snorts, and in that snort is sublimated the wisdom
      and experience of a ripe ninety years on Park Row. Speak, O Compendium of
      all the&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Tommy,&rdquo; interrupted Edmonds. He resumed his pipe,
      gave it two anxious puffs, and, satisfied of its continued vitality, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banneker, uh? Resign, uh? You think he would?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does <i>he</i> think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my belief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pronounced the veteran with finality.
      &ldquo;They never do. They chafe. They strain. They curse out the job and
      themselves. They say it isn&rsquo;t fit for any white man. So it isn&rsquo;t,
      the worst of it. But they stick. If they&rsquo;re marked for it, they
      stick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marked for it?&rdquo; murmured Glidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ink-spot. The mark of the beast. I&rsquo;ve got it. You&rsquo;ve
      got it, Glidden, and you, McHale. Mallory&rsquo;s smudged with it. Tommy
      thinks it&rsquo;s all over him, but it isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;ll end
      between covers. Fiction, like as not,&rdquo; he added with a mildly
      contemptuous smile. &ldquo;But this young Banneker; it&rsquo;s eaten into
      him like acid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him, Pop?&rdquo; inquired McHale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him. Don&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;ve read his stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see it there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain as Brooklyn Bridge. He&rsquo;ll eat mud like the rest of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off, Pop! Where do you come in to eat mud? You&rsquo;ve got
      the creamiest job on Park Row. You never have to do anything that a
      railroad president need shy at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was nearly true. Edmonds, who in his thirty years of service had
      filled almost every conceivable position from police headquarters reporter
      to managing editor, had now reverted to the phase for which the ink-spot
      had marked him, and was again a reporter; a sort of super-reporter,
      spending much of his time out around the country on important projects
      either of news, or of that special information necessary to a great daily,
      which does not always appear as news, but which may define, determine, or
      alter news and editorial policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of him it was said on Park Row, and not without reason, that he was bigger
      than his paper, which screened him behind a traditional principle of
      anonymity, for The Courier was of the second rank in metropolitan
      journalism and wavered between an indigenous Bourbonism and a desire to be
      thought progressive. The veteran&rsquo;s own creed was frankly
      socialistic; but in the Fabian phase. His was a patient philosophy,
      content with slow progress; but upon one point he was a passionate
      enthusiast. He believed in the widest possible scope of education, and in
      the fundamental duty of the press to stimulate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the Social Revolution just as soon as we&rsquo;re
      educated up to it,&rdquo; he was wont to declare. &ldquo;If we get it
      before then, it&rsquo;ll be a worse hash than capitalism. So let&rsquo;s
      go slow and learn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For such a mind to be contributing to an organ of The Courier type might
      seem anomalous. Often Edmonds accused himself of shameful compromise; the
      kind of compromise constantly necessary to hold his place. Yet it was not
      any consideration of self-interest that bound him. He could have commanded
      higher pay in half a dozen open positions. Or, he could have afforded to
      retire, and write as he chose, for he had been a shrewd investor with wide
      opportunities. What really held him was his ability to forward almost
      imperceptibly through the kind of news political and industrial, which he,
      above all other journalists of his day, was able to determine and analyze,
      the radical projects dear to his heart. Nothing could have had a more
      titillating appeal to his sardonic humor than the furious editorial
      refutations in The Courier, of facts and tendencies plainly enunciated by
      him in the news columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, his impotency to speak out openly and individually the faith
      that was in him, left always a bitter residue in his mind. It now informed
      his answer to Van Cleve&rsquo;s characterization of his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can sneak a tenth of the truth past the copy-desk,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing well. And what sort of man am I when I go up
      against these big-bugs of industry at their conventions, and conferences,
      appearing as representative of The Courier which represents their
      interests? A damned hypocrite, I&rsquo;d say! If they had brains enough to
      read between the lines of my stuff, they&rsquo;d see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Mallory lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, once. I told the President of the United Manufacturers&rsquo;
      Association what I really thought of their attitude toward labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what result?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ordered The Courier to fire me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But he isn&rsquo;t. I went after him on his record.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which doesn&rsquo;t sound much like mud-eating, Pop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my bit of that in my time, too. I&rsquo;ve had jobs
      to do that a self-respecting swill-hustler wouldn&rsquo;t touch. I&rsquo;ve
      sworn I wouldn&rsquo;t do em. And I&rsquo;ve done &rsquo;em, rather than
      lose my job. Just as young Banneker will, when the test comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mallory, who had been called away, returned in time to hear this. &ldquo;You
      might ask him to settle the bet,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      just had him on the &lsquo;phone. He&rsquo;s coming around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival Banneker was introduced to those of the men whom he did not
      know, and seated next to Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking about you, young fellow,&rdquo; said the
      veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      From most men Banneker would have found the form of address patronizing.
      But the thin, knotty face of Edmonds was turned upon him with so kindly a
      regard in the hollow eyes that he felt an innate stir of knowledge that
      here was a man who might be a friend. He made no answer, however, merely
      glancing at the speaker. To learn that the denizens of Park Row were
      discussing him, caused him neither surprise nor elation. While he knew
      that he had made hit after hit with his work, he was not inclined to
      over-value the easily won reputation. Edmonds&rsquo;s next remark did not
      please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were discussing how much dirt you&rsquo;d eat to hold your job
      on The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ledger doesn&rsquo;t ask its men to eat dirt, Edmonds,&rdquo;
      put in Mallory sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chop, fried potatoes, coffee, and a stein of Nicklas-brau,&rdquo;
      Banneker specified across the table to the waiter. He studied the
      mimeographed bill-of-fare with selective attention. &ldquo;And a slice of
      apple pie,&rdquo; he decided. Without change of tone, he looked up over
      the top of the menu at Edmonds slowly puffing his insignificant pipe and
      said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your assumption, Mr. Edmonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ugly,&rdquo; admitted the other, &ldquo;but you have to
      answer it. Oh, not to me!&rdquo; he added, smiling. &ldquo;To yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t come my way yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will. Ask any of these fellows. We&rsquo;ve all had to meet it.
      Yes; you, too, Mallory. We&rsquo;ve all had to eat our peck of dirt in the
      sacred name of news. Some are too squeamish. They quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re too squeamish, they&rsquo;d never make real
      newspaper men,&rdquo; pronounced McHale. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be too
      good for your business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt acidly, &ldquo;but your business
      can be too bad for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be news. And if there&rsquo;s got to be news
      there have got to be men willing to do hard, unpleasant work, to get it,&rdquo;
      argued Mallory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard? All right,&rdquo; retorted Edmonds. &ldquo;Unpleasant? Who
      cares! I&rsquo;m talking about the dirty work. Wait a minute, Mallory.
      Didn&rsquo;t you ever have an assignment that was an outrage on some
      decent man&rsquo;s privacy? Or, maybe woman&rsquo;s? Something that made
      you sick at your stomach to have to do? Did you ever have to take a couple
      of drinks to give you nerve to ask some question that ought to have got
      you kicked downstairs for asking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mallory, flushing angrily, was silent. But McHale spoke up. &ldquo;Hell!
      Every business has its stinks, I guess. What about being a lawyer and
      serving papers? Or a manufacturer and having to bootlick the buyers? I
      tell you, if the public wants a certain kind of news, it&rsquo;s the
      newspaper&rsquo;s business to serve it to &rsquo;em; and it&rsquo;s the
      newspaper man&rsquo;s business to get it for his paper. I say it&rsquo;s
      up to the public.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public,&rdquo; murmured Edmonds. &ldquo;Swill-eaters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Then give &rsquo;em the kind of swill they want,&rdquo;
      cried McHale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds so manipulated his little pipe that it pointed directly at
      Banneker. &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em the kind of swill they want? You seem to like to
      keep your hands clean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you asking me your original question in another form?&rdquo;
      smiled the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You objected to it before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer it now. A friend of mine wrote to me when I went
      on The Ledger, advising me always to be ready on a moment&rsquo;s notice
      to look my job between the eyes and tell it to go to hell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve known that done, too,&rdquo; interpolated Mallory.
      &ldquo;But in those cases it isn&rsquo;t the job that goes.&rdquo; He
      pushed back his chair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Pop Edmonds corrupt you with
      his pessimism, Banneker,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean
      half of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the seal of the profession,&rdquo; said the veteran. &ldquo;If
      there were outsiders present, it would be different. I&rsquo;d have to
      admit that ours is the greatest, noblest, most high-minded and inspired
      business in the world. Free and enlightened press. Fearless defender of
      the right. Incorruptible agent of the people&rsquo;s will. Did I say
      &lsquo;people&rsquo;s will&rsquo; or people&rsquo;s swill&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t
      ask me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The others paid their accounts and followed Mallory out, leaving Banneker
      alone at the table with the saturnine elder. Edmonds put a thumbful of
      tobacco in his pipe, and puffed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will it get a man?&rdquo; asked Banneker, setting down his
      coffee-cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This game?&rdquo; queried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What shall it profit a man,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted the veteran
      ruminatively. &ldquo;You know the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Banneker decidedly. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do.
      These fellows here haven&rsquo;t sold their souls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or lost &rsquo;em. Maybe not,&rdquo; admitted the elder. &ldquo;Though
      I wouldn&rsquo;t gamble strong on some of &rsquo;em. But they&rsquo;ve
      lost something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to get at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Independence. They&rsquo;re merged in the paper they write for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man&rsquo;s got to subordinate himself to his business, if he&rsquo;s
      to do justice to it and himself, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If you&rsquo;re buying or selling stocks or socks, it doesn&rsquo;t
      matter. The principles you live by aren&rsquo;t involved. In the newspaper
      game they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in reporting, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If reporting were just gathering facts and presenting them, it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be so. But you&rsquo;re deep enough in by now to see that
      reporting of a lot of things is a matter of coloring your version to the
      general policy of your paper. Politics, for instance, or the liquor
      question, or labor troubles. The best reporters get to doing it
      unconsciously. Chameleons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think it affects them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it help? There&rsquo;s a slow poison in writing one way
      when you believe another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s part of the dirt-eating?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. Not so obvious as some of the other kinds. Those hurt
      your pride, mostly. This kind hurts your self-respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where does it get you, all this business?&rdquo; asked Banneker
      reverting to his first query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fifty-two years old,&rdquo; replied Edmonds quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker stared. &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;And
      you&rsquo;re considered a success. Of course you <i>are</i> a success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Park Row. Would you like to be me? At fifty-two?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Banneker with a frankness which
      brought a faint smile to the other man&rsquo;s tired face. &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ve
      got where you started for, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I could answer that if I knew where I started for or where
      I&rsquo;ve got to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it that you&rsquo;ve got what you were after, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;s the answer. Upper-case No. I want to get certain things
      over to the public intelligence. Maybe I&rsquo;ve got one per cent of them
      over. Not more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something. To have a public that will follow you even
      part way&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me? Bless you; they don&rsquo;t know me except as a lot of
      print that they occasionally read. I&rsquo;m as anonymous as an editorial
      writer. And that&rsquo;s the most anonymous thing there is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t suit me at all,&rdquo; declared Banneker.
      &ldquo;If I have got anything in me&mdash;and I think I have&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      want it to make a noise like a part of a big machine. I&rsquo;d rather
      make a small noise of my own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy a paper, then. Or write fluffy criticisms about art or
      theaters. Or get into the magazine field. You can write; O Lord! yes, you
      can write. But unless you&rsquo;ve got the devotion of a fanatic like
      McHale, or a born servant of the machine like &lsquo;Parson&rsquo; Gale,
      or an old fool like me, willing to sink your identity in your work, you&rsquo;ll
      never be content as a reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something. Why do none of the men, talking among
      themselves, ever refer to themselves as reporters. It&rsquo;s always
      &lsquo;newspaper men.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds shot a swift glance at him. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he decided slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because there
      is a sort of stigma attached to reporting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you, you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; snapped the veteran. &ldquo;Though
      it&rsquo;s the rankest heresy to admit it. There&rsquo;s a taint about it.
      There&rsquo;s a touch of the pariah. We try to fool ourselves into
      thinking there isn&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s there, and we admit it when we
      use a clumsy, misfit term like &lsquo;newspaper man.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose fault is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public&rsquo;s. The public is a snob. It likes to look down on
      brains. Particularly the business man. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a
      Socialist. I&rsquo;m ag&rsquo;in the bourgeoisie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the newspapers to blame, in the kind of stuff they
      print?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do they print it?&rdquo; demanded the other fiercely.
      &ldquo;Because the public wants all the filth and scandal and invasion of
      privacy that it can get and still feel respectable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ledger doesn&rsquo;t go in for that sort of thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as much as some of the others. But a little more each year. It
      follows the trend.&rdquo; He got up, quenched his pipe, and reached for
      his hat. &ldquo;Drop in here about seven-thirty when you feel like hearing
      the old man maunder,&rdquo; he said with his slight, friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, Banneker leaned over to him. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the man at the
      next table?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice, indicating a tall, broad,
      glossily dressed diner who was sipping his third <i>demi-tasse</i>, in
      apparent detachment from the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Marrineal,&rdquo; replied the veteran. &ldquo;He dines
      here occasionally alone. Don&rsquo;t know what he does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been listening in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious thing; he often does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they parted at the door, Edmonds said paternally:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, young fellow, a Park Row reputation is written on glass
      with a wet finger. It doesn&rsquo;t last during the writing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And only dims the glass,&rdquo; said Banneker reflectively.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Heat, sudden, savage, and oppressive, bore down upon the city early that
      spring, smiting men in their offices, women in their homes, the horses
      between the shafts of their toil, so that the city was in danger of
      becoming disorganized. The visitation developed into the big story of
      successive days. It was the sort of generalized, picturesque &ldquo;fluff-stuff&rdquo;
      matter which Banneker could handle better than his compeers by sheer
      imaginative grasp and deftness of presentation. Being now a writer on
      space, paid at the rate of eight dollars a column of from thirteen to
      nineteen hundred words, he found the assignment profitable and the test of
      skill quite to his taste. Soft job though it was in a way, however, the
      unrelenting pressure of the heat and the task of finding, day after day,
      new phases and fresh phrases in which to deal with it, made inroads upon
      his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took to sleeping ill again. Io Welland had come back in all the
      glamorous panoply of waking dreams to command and torment his loneliness
      of spirit. At night he dreaded the return to the draughtless room on Grove
      Street. In the morning, rising sticky-eyed and unrested, he shrank from
      the thought of the humid, dusty, unkempt hurly-burly of the office. Yet
      his work was never more brilliant and individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his writing, one reeking midnight, he sat, spent, at his
      desk, hating the thought of the shut-in place that he called home. Better
      to spend the night on a bench in some square, as he had done often enough
      in the earlier days. He rose, took his hat, and had reached the first
      landing when the steps wavered and faded in front of him and he found
      himself clutching for the rail. A pair of hands gripped his shoulders and
      held him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; asked a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; muttered Banneker. &ldquo;I wish I were back on the
      desert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want a drink,&rdquo; prescribed his volunteer prop.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his vision and control reestablished themselves, Banneker found himself
      being led downstairs and to the nearest bar by young Fentriss Smith, who
      ordered two soda cocktails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Smith he knew little except that the office called him &ldquo;the
      permanent twenty-five-dollar man.&rdquo; He was one of those earnest,
      faithful, totally uninspired reporters, who can be relied upon implicitly
      for routine news, but are constitutionally impotent to impart color and
      life to any subject whatsoever. Patiently he had seen younger and newer
      men overtake and pass him; but he worked on inexorably, asking for
      nothing, wearing the air of a scholar with some distant and abstruse
      determination in view. Like Banneker he had no intimates in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The desert,&rdquo; echoed Smith in his quiet, well-bred voice.
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pretty hot, there, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s open,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smothering
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look frazzled out, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel frazzled out; that&rsquo;s what I mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you come out with me to-night as soon as I report to the
      desk,&rdquo; suggested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, refreshed by the tingling drink, looked down at him in surprise.
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little boat out here in the East River.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boat? Lord, that sounds good!&rdquo; sighed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it? Then see here! Why couldn&rsquo;t you put in a few days
      with me, and cool off? I&rsquo;ve often wanted to talk to you about the
      newspaper business, and get your ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m newer at it than you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a fact! Just the same you&rsquo;ve got the trick of it and I
      haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll go around to your place while you pack a
      suitcase, and we&rsquo;re off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good of you.&rdquo; Accustomed though he was to
      the swift and ready comradeship of a newspaper office, Banneker was
      puzzled by this advance from the shy and remote Smith. &ldquo;All right:
      if you&rsquo;ll let me share expenses,&rdquo; he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith seemed taken aback at this. &ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; he
      assented. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t quite know&mdash;We&rsquo;ll talk of
      that later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Banneker was packing in his room, Smith, seated on the window-sill,
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to tell you that we have to go through a bad district to
      get there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tunnel Gang?&rdquo; asked Banneker, wise in the plague spots of
      the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this side of their stamping ground. It&rsquo;s a gang of wharf
      rats. There have been a number of hold-ups, and last week a dead woman was
      found under the pier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker made an unobtrusive addition to his packing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
      have to move fast to catch me,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of us together won&rsquo;t be molested. But if you&rsquo;re
      alone, be careful. The police in that precinct are no good. They&rsquo;re
      either afraid or they stand in with the gang.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Fifth Avenue the pair got a late-cruising taxicab whose driver,
      however, declined to take them nearer than one block short of the pier.
      &ldquo;The night air in that place ain&rsquo;t good fer weak
      constitutions,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;One o&rsquo; my pals got a
      headache last week down on the pier from bein&rsquo; beaned with a
      sandbag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one interfered with the two reporters, however. A whistle from the end
      of the pier evolved from the watery dimness a dinghy, which, in a hundred
      yards of rowing, delivered them into a small but perfectly appointed
      yacht. Banneker, looking about the luxurious cabin, laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a bad guess of mine about half expenses,&rdquo; he said
      good-humoredly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to mortgage my future for a year. Do
      you own this craft?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father does. He&rsquo;s been called back West.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bells rang, the wheel began to churn, and Banneker, falling asleep in his
      berth with a vivifying breeze blowing across him, awoke in broad daylight
      to a view of sparkling little waves which danced across his vision to
      smack impudently the flanks of the speeding craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in by noon,&rdquo; was Smith&rsquo;s greeting as
      they met on the companionway for a swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do it for?&rdquo; asked Banneker, seated at the
      breakfast table, with an appetite such as he had not known for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men&rsquo;s work at twenty-five per for The Ledger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Training.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to stick to the business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family,&rdquo; explained Smith, &ldquo;own a newspaper in
      Toledo. It fell to them by accident. Our real business is manufacturing
      farm machinery, and none of us has ever tried or thought of manufacturing
      newspapers. So they wished on me the job of learning how.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly. But I&rsquo;m going through with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker felt a new and surprised respect for his host. He could forecast
      the kind of small city newspaper that Smith would make; careful,
      conscientious, regular in politics, loyal to what it deemed the best
      interests of the community, single-minded in its devotion to the Smith
      family and its properties; colorless, characterless, and without vision or
      leadership in all that a newspaper should, according to Banneker&rsquo;s
      opinion, stand for. So he talked with the fervor of an enthusiast, a
      missionary, a devotee, who saw in that daily chronicle of the news an
      agency to stir men&rsquo;s minds and spur their thoughts, if need be, to
      action; at the same time the mechanism and instrument of power, of
      achievement, of success. Fentriss Smith listened and was troubled in
      spirit by these unknown fires. He had supposed respectability to be the
      final aim and end of a sound newspaper tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparent intimacy which had sprung up between twenty-five-dollar Smith
      and the reserved, almost hermit-like Banneker was the subject of curious
      and amused commentary in The Ledger office. Mallory hazarded a humorous
      guess that Banneker was tutoring Smith in the finer arts of journalism,
      which was not so far amiss as its proponent might have supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Heat broke several evenings later in a drench of rain and wind.
      This, being in itself important news, kept Banneker late at his writing,
      and he had told his host not to wait, that he would join him on the yacht
      sometime about midnight. So Smith had gone on alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Tommy Burt, lounging into the office from an early
      assignment, approached the City Desk with a twinkle far back in his lively
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear anything of a shoot-fest up in the Bad Lands last night?&rdquo;
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Mr. Greenough. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting
      to be everyday occurrences up there. Is it on the police slips, Mr.
      Mallory?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Nothing in that line,&rdquo; answered the assistant, looking
      over his assortment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police are probably suppressing it,&rdquo; opined Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the story?&rdquo; queried Mr. Greenough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In outline. It isn&rsquo;t really my story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is it, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of it.&rdquo; Tommy Burt leaned against Mallory&rsquo;s
      desk and appeared to be revolving some delectable thought in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Mallory, &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t open that
      committee meeting you&rsquo;ve been attending with a corkscrew, did they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m intoxicated with the chaste beauties of my story, which
      isn&rsquo;t mine,&rdquo; returned the dreamily smiling Mr. Burt. &ldquo;Here
      it is, boiled down. Guest on an anchored yacht returning late, sober,
      through the mist. Wharf-gang shooting craps in a pier-shed. They size him
      up and go to it; six of &rsquo;em. Knives and one gun: maybe more. The old
      game: one asks for the time. Another sneaks up behind and gives the victim
      the elbow-garrote. The rest rush him. Well, they got as far as the
      garrote. Everything lovely and easy. Then Mr. Victim introduces a few
      specialties. Picks a gun from somewhere around his shirt-front, shoots the
      garroter over his shoulder; kills the man in front, who is at him with a
      stiletto, ducks a couple of shots from the gang, and lays out two more of
      &rsquo;em. The rest take to the briny. Tally: two dead, one dying, one
      wounded, Mr. Guest walks to the shore end, meets two patrolmen, and turns
      in his gun. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done a job for you,&rsquo; says he. So they
      pinch him. He&rsquo;s in the police station, <i>incomunicado</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the narrative, Mr. Greenough had thrown in little, purring
      interjections of &ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!
      good!&rdquo; At the conclusion Mallory exclaimed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses! That is a story! You say it isn&rsquo;t yours? Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s Banneker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the guest with the gun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mallory jumped in his chair. &ldquo;Banneker!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh,
      hell!&rdquo; he added disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takes the shine out of the story, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; observed
      Burt with a malicious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the anomalous superstitions of newspaperdom is that nothing which
      happens to a reporter in the line of his work is or can be &ldquo;big
      news.&rdquo; The mere fact that he is a reporter is enough to blight the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was Banneker doing down there?&rdquo; queried Mr. Greenough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visiting on a yacht.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; There was a ray of hope in the other&rsquo;s
      face. The glamour of yachting association might be made to cast a radiance
      about the event, in which the damnatory fact that the principal figure was
      a mere reporter could be thrown into low relief. Such is the view which
      journalistic snobbery takes of the general public&rsquo;s snobbery.
      &ldquo;Whose yacht?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the spiteful little smile appealed on Burt&rsquo;s lips as he dashed
      the rising hope. &ldquo;Fentriss Smith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the expletive of disillusion burst from between Mallory&rsquo;s
      teeth as he saw the front-page double-column spread, a type-specialty of
      the usually conservative Ledger upon which it prided itself, dwindle to a
      carefully handled inside-page three-quarter of a column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that Mr. Banneker is in the police station?&rdquo; asked
      the city editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at headquarters. They&rsquo;re probably working the third degree
      on him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; declared the city desk incumbent, with
      conviction. He caught up the telephone, got the paper&rsquo;s City Hall
      reporter, and was presently engaged in some polite but pointed suggestions
      to His Honor the Mayor. Shortly after, Police Headquarters called; the
      Chief himself was on the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ledger is behind Mr. Banneker, Chief,&rdquo; said Mr. Greenough
      crisply. &ldquo;Carrying concealed weapons? If your men in that precinct
      were fit to be on the force, there would be no need for private citizens
      to go armed. You get the point, I see. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I am a bad guesser we&rsquo;ll have Banneker back here by
      evening. And there&rsquo;ll be no manhandling in his case,&rdquo; Mallory
      said to Burt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counsel was taken of Mr. Gordon, as soon as that astute managing editor
      arrived, as to the handling of the difficult situation. The Ledger, always
      cynically intolerant of any effort to better the city government, as
      savoring of &ldquo;goo-gooism,&rdquo; which was its special <i>bête noire</i>,
      could not well make the shooting a basis for a general attack upon police
      laxity, though it was in this that lay the special news possibility of the
      event. On the other hand, the thing was far too sensational to be ignored
      or too much slurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andreas, the assistant managing editor, in charge of the paper&rsquo;s
      make-up, a true news-hound with an untainted delight in the unusual and
      striking, no matter what its setting might be, who had been called into
      the conference, advocated &ldquo;smearing it all over the front page, with
      Banneker&rsquo;s first-hand statement for the lead&mdash;pictures too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Him, Mr. Greenough, impassive joss of the city desk, regarded with a chill
      eye. &ldquo;One reporter visiting another gets into a muss and shoots up
      some riverside toughs,&rdquo; he remarked contemptuously. &ldquo;You can
      hardly expect our public to get greatly excited over that. Are we going
      into the business of exploiting our own cubs?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon there was sharp discussion to which Mr. Gordon put an end by
      remarking that the evening papers would doubtless give them a lead;
      meantime they could get Banneker&rsquo;s version.
    </p>
    <p>
      First to come in was The Evening New Yorker, the most vapid of all the
      local prints, catering chiefly to the uptown and shopping element. Its
      heading half-crossed the page proclaiming &ldquo;Guest of Yachtsman Shoots
      Down Thugs.&rdquo; Nowhere in the article did it appear that Banneker had
      any connection with the newspaper world. He was made to appear as a young
      Westerner on a visit to the yacht of a millionaire business man, having
      come on from his ranch in the desert, and presumptively&mdash;to add the
      touch of godhead&mdash;a millionaire himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stinking liars!&rdquo; said Andreas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; declared Mr. Gordon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      give the facts plainly and without sensationalism; but all the facts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Including Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s connection here?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
      Greenough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other evening papers, more honest than The Evening New Yorker,
      admitted, though, as it were, regretfully and in an inconspicuous finale
      to their accounts that the central figure of the sensation was only a
      reporter. But the fact of his being guest on a yacht was magnified and
      glorified.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock Banneker arrived, having been bailed out after some
      difficulty, for the police were frightened and ugly, foreseeing that this
      swift vengeance upon the notorious gang, meted out by a private hand,
      would throw a vivid light upon their own inefficiency and complaisance.
      Happily the District Attorney&rsquo;s office was engaged in one of its
      periodical feuds with the Police Department over some matter of graft gone
      astray, and was more inclined to make a cat&rsquo;s-paw than a victim out
      of Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though inwardly strung to a high pitch, for the police officials had kept
      him sleepless through the night by their habitual inquisition, Banneker
      held himself well in hand as he went to the City Desk to report gravely
      that he had been unable to come earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we understand, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; said Mr. Greenough, his
      placid features for once enlivened. &ldquo;That was a good job you did. I
      congratulate you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Greenough,&rdquo; returned Banneker. &ldquo;I had to
      do it or get done. And, at that, it wasn&rsquo;t much of a trick. They
      were a yellow lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely: very likely. You&rsquo;ve handled a gun before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in practice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever shot anybody before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does it feel?&rdquo; inquired the city editor, turning his pale
      eyes on the other and fussing nervously with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first you want to go on killing,&rdquo; answered Banneker.
      &ldquo;Then, when it&rsquo;s over, there&rsquo;s a big let-down. It doesn&rsquo;t
      seem as if it were you.&rdquo; He paused and added boyishly: &ldquo;The
      evening papers are making an awful fuss over it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect? It isn&rsquo;t every day that a Wild West Show
      with real bullets and blood is staged in this effete town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I knew there&rsquo;d be a kick-up about it,&rdquo;
      admitted Banneker. &ldquo;But, some way&mdash;well, in the West, if a gang
      gets shot up, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of talk for a while, and the boys
      want to buy the drinks for the fellow that does it, but it doesn&rsquo;t
      spread all over the front pages. I suppose I still have something of the
      Western view.... How much did you want of this, Mr. Greenough?&rdquo; he
      concluded in a business-like tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not doing the story, Mr. Banneker. Tommy Burt is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not writing it? Not any of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. You&rsquo;re the hero&rdquo;&mdash;there was a hint
      of elongation of the first syllable which might have a sardonic
      connotation from those pale and placid lips&mdash;&ldquo;not the
      historian. Burt will interview you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Patriot reporter has already. I gave him a statement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greenough frowned. &ldquo;It would have been as well to have waited.
      However.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Banneker,&rdquo; put in Mallory, &ldquo;Judge Enderby wants you
      to call at his office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Judge Enderby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chief Googler of the Goo-Goos; the Law Enforcement Society lot.
      They call him the ablest honest lawyer in New York. He&rsquo;s an old
      crab. Hates the newspapers, particularly us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cherishes some theory,&rdquo; said Mr. Greenough in his most
      toneless voice, &ldquo;that a newspaper ought to be conducted solely in
      the interests of people like himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any reason why I should go chasing around to see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you choose. He doesn&rsquo;t see reporters often.
      Perhaps it would be as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His outfit are after the police,&rdquo; explained Mallory. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what he wants you for. It&rsquo;s part of their political game. Always
      politics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he can wait until to-morrow, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked
      Banneker indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenough examined him with impenetrable gaze. This was a very cavalier
      attitude toward Judge Willis Enderby. For Enderby was a man of real power.
      He might easily have been the most munificently paid corporation attorney
      in the country but for the various kinds of business which he would not,
      in his own homely phrase, &ldquo;poke at with a burnt stick.&rdquo;
      Notwithstanding his prejudices, he was confidential legal adviser, in
      personal and family affairs, to a considerable percentage of the important
      men and women of New York. He was supposed to be the only man who could
      handle that bull-elephant of finance, ruler of Wall Street, and, when he
      chose to give it his contemptuous attention, dictator, through his son and
      daughters, of the club and social world of New York, old Poultney Masters,
      in the apoplectic rages into which the slightest thwart to his will
      plunged him. To Enderby&rsquo;s adroitness the financier (one of whose pet
      vanities was a profound and wholly baseless faith in himself as a
      connoisseur of art) owed it that he had not become a laughing-stock
      through his purchase of a pair of particularly flagrant Murillos, planted
      for his special behoof by a gang of clever Italian swindlers. Rumor had it
      that when Enderby had privately summed up his client&rsquo;s case for his
      client&rsquo;s benefit before his client as referee, in these words:
      &ldquo;And, Mr. Masters, if you act again in these matters without
      consulting me, you must find another lawyer; I cannot afford fools for
      clients&rdquo;&mdash;they had to call in a physician and resort to the
      ancient expedient of bleeding, to save the great man&rsquo;s cerebral
      arteries from bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the public press, Enderby&rsquo;s attitude was the exact reverse of
      Horace Vanney&rsquo;s. For himself, he unaffectedly disliked and despised
      publicity; for the interests which he represented, he delegated it to
      others. He would rarely be interviewed; his attitude toward the newspapers
      was consistently repellent. Consequently his infrequent utterances were
      treasured as pearls, and given a prominence far above those of the too
      eager and over-friendly Mr. Vanney, who, incidentally, was his associate
      on the directorate of the Law Enforcement Society. The newspapers did not
      like Willis Enderby any more than he liked them. But they cherished for
      him an unrequited respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a reporter, a nobody of yesterday whose association with The Ledger
      constituted his only claim to any status whatever, should profess
      indifference to a summons from a man of Enderby&rsquo;s position,
      suggested affectation to Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s suspicions. Young Mr.
      Banneker&rsquo;s head was already swelling, was it? Very well; in the
      course of time and his duties, Mr. Greenough would apply suitable
      remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Banneker were, indeed, taking a good conceit of himself from the
      conspicuous position achieved so unexpectedly, the morning papers did
      nothing to allay it. Most of them slurred over, as lightly as possible,
      the fact of his journalistic connection; as in the evening editions, the
      yacht feature was kept to the fore. There were two exceptions. The Ledger
      itself, in a colorless and straightforward article, frankly identified the
      hero of the episode, in the introductory sentence, as a member of its city
      staff, and his host of the yacht as another journalist. But there was one
      notable omission about which Banneker determined to ask Tommy Burt as soon
      as he could see him. The Patriot, most sensational of the morning issues,
      splurged wildly under the caption, &ldquo;Yacht Guest Cleans Out Gang
      Which Cowed Police.&rdquo; The Sphere, in an editorial, demanded a
      sweeping and honest investigation of the conditions which made life unsafe
      in the greatest of cities. The Sphere was always demanding sweeping and
      honest investigations, and not infrequently getting them. In Greenough&rsquo;s
      opinion this undesirable result was likely to be achieved now. To Mr.
      Gordon he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to shut down all we can on the Banneker follow-up. An
      investigation with our man as prosecuting witness would put us in the
      position of trying to reform the police, and would play into the hands of
      the Enderby crowd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The managing editor shook a wise and grizzled head. &ldquo;If The Patriot
      keeps up its whooping and The Sphere its demanding, the administration
      will have to do something. After all, Mr. Greenough, things have become
      pretty unendurable in the Murder Precinct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But the signed statement of Banneker&rsquo;s in
      The Patriot&mdash;it&rsquo;s really an interview faked up as a statement&mdash;is
      a savage attack on the whole administration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gordon, &ldquo;that they were
      going to beat him up scientifically in the station house when Smith came
      in and scared them out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Banneker is pretty angry over it. You can&rsquo;t blame him.
      But that&rsquo;s no reason why we should alienate the city
      administration.... Then you think, Mr. Gordon, that we&rsquo;ll have to
      keep the story running?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Mr. Greenough, that we&rsquo;ll have to give the news,&rdquo;
      answered the managing editor austerely. &ldquo;Where is Banneker now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Judge Enderby, I believe. In case of an investigation he won&rsquo;t
      be much use to us until it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gordon serenely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      stand by our man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had gone to the old-fashioned offices of Enderby and Enderby, in
      a somewhat inimical frame of mind. Expectant of an invitation to aid the
      Law Enforcement Society in cleaning up a pest-hole of crime, he was half
      determined to have as little to do with it as possible. Overnight
      consideration had developed in him the theory that the function of a
      newspaper is informative, not reformative; that when a newspaper man has
      correctly adduced and frankly presented the facts, his social as well as
      his professional duty is done. Others might hew out the trail thus blazed;
      the reporter, bearing his searchlight, should pass on to other dark spots.
      All his theories evaporated as soon as he confronted Judge Enderby,
      forgotten in the interest inspired by the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A portrait painter once said of Willis Enderby that his face was that of a
      saint, illumined, not by inspiration, but by shrewdness. With his
      sensitiveness to beauty of whatever kind, Banneker felt the extraordinary
      quality of the face, beneath its grim outline, interpreting it from the
      still depth of the quiet eyes rather than from the stern mouth and rather
      tyrannous nose. He was prepared for an abrupt and cold manner, and was
      surprised when the lawyer rose to shake hands, giving him a greeting of
      courtly congratulation upon his courage and readiness. If the purpose of
      this was to get Banneker to expand, as he suspected, it failed. The
      visitor sensed the cold reserve behind the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be good enough to run through this document?&rdquo;
      requested the lawyer, motioning Banneker to a seat opposite himself, and
      handing him a brief synopsis of what the Law Enforcement Society hoped to
      prove regarding police laxity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercising that double faculty of mind which later became a part of the
      Banneker legend in New York journalism, the reader, whilst absorbing the
      main and quite simple points of the report, recalled an instance in which
      an Atkinson and St. Philip ticket agent had been maneuvered into a posture
      facing a dazzling sunset, and had adjusted his vision to find it focused
      upon the barrel of a 45. Without suspecting the Judge of hold-up designs,
      he nevertheless developed a parallel. Leaving his chair he walked over and
      sat by the window. Halfway through the document, he quietly laid it aside
      and returned the lawyer&rsquo;s studious regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; asked Judge Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not find it interesting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less interesting than your idea in giving it to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you conceive that to have been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of reply, Banneker cited the case of Tim Lake, the robbed agent.
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he added with a half smile, &ldquo;that you and I
      will do better in the open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too. Mr. Banneker, are you honest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I came from, that would be regarded as a trouble-hunter&rsquo;s
      question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you to regard it as important and take it without offense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; returned Banneker gravely.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. Honest, you say. Are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you begin by doubting the honesty of a stranger against
      whom you know nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legal habit, I dare say. Fortified, in this case, by your
      association with The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a high opinion of my paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very highest, of its adroitness and expertness. It can make the
      better cause appear the worse with more skill than any other journal in
      America.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was the specialty of lawyers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Enderby accepted the touch with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lawyer is an avowed special pleader. He represents one side. A
      newspaper is supposed to be without bias and to present the facts for the
      information of its one client, the public. You will readily appreciate the
      difference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Then you don&rsquo;t consider The Ledger honest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Enderby&rsquo;s composed glance settled upon the morning&rsquo;s
      issue, spread upon his desk. &ldquo;I have, I assume, the same opinion of
      The Ledger&rsquo;s honesty that you have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind explaining that to me quite simply, so that I shall be
      sure to understand it?&rdquo; invited Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read the article about your exploit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that honest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as accurate a job as I&rsquo;ve ever known done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted. Is it honest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the other after a pause.
      &ldquo;I intend to find out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to find out why it is so reticent on every point that
      might impugn the police, I take it. I could tell you; but yours is the
      better way. You gave the same interview to your own paper that you gave to
      The Patriot, I assume. By the way, what a commentary on journalism that
      the most scurrilous sheet in New York should have given the fullest and
      frankest treatment to the subject; a paper written by the dregs of Park
      Row for the reading of race-track touts and ignorant servant girls!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I gave them the same interview. It may have been crowded out&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For lack of space,&rdquo; supplied Enderby in a tone which the
      other heartily disliked. &ldquo;Mr. Banneker, I thought that this was to
      be in the open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrong,&rdquo; confessed the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know
      by this evening why the police part was handled that way, and if it was
      policy&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go through to the finish with your committee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as good as pledged,&rdquo; retorted the lawyer.
      &ldquo;I shall expect to hear from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he could find Tommy Burt, Banneker put to him the direct
      question. &ldquo;What is the matter with the story as I gave it to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burt assumed an air of touching innocence. &ldquo;The story had to be
      handled with great care,&rdquo; he explained blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off, Tommy. Didn&rsquo;t you write the police part?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Burl&rsquo;s eyes denoted the extreme of candor. &ldquo;It was
      suggested to me that your views upon the police, while interesting and
      even important, might be misunderstood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> so? And who made the suggestion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An all-wise city desk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Tommy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Morning Ledger,&rdquo; volunteered Tommy Burt, &ldquo;has a
      high and well-merited reputation for its fidelity to the principles of
      truth and fairness and to the best interests of the reading public. It
      never gives the public any news to play with that it thinks the dear
      little thing ought not to have. Did you say anything? No? Well; you meant
      it. You&rsquo;re wrong. The Ledger is the highest-class newspaper in New
      York. We are the Elect!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first revulsion of anger, Banneker was for going to Mr. Greenough
      and having it out with him. If it meant his resignation, very good. He was
      ready to look his job in the eye and tell it to go to hell. Turning the
      matter over in his mind, however, he decided upon another course. So far
      as the sensational episode of which he was the central figure went, he
      would regard himself consistently as a private citizen with no
      responsibility whatsoever to The Ledger. Let the paper print or suppress
      what it chose; his attitude toward it would be identical with his attitude
      toward the other papers. Probably the office powers would heartily
      disapprove of his having any dealings with Enderby and his Law Enforcement
      Society. Let them! He telephoned a brief but final message to Enderby and
      Enderby. When, late that night, Mr. Gordon called him over and suggested
      that it was highly desirable to let the whole affair drop out of public
      notice as soon as the startling facts would permit, he replied that Judge
      Enderby had already arranged to push an investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; observed the managing editor. &ldquo;It is his
      specialty. But without your evidence they can&rsquo;t go far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can have my evidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon, who had been delicately balancing his letter-opener, now
      delivered a whack of such unthinking ferocity upon his fat knuckle as to
      produce a sharp pang. He gazed in surprise and reproach upon the aching
      thumb and something of those emotions informed the regard which he turned
      slowly upon Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s frame of mind was unenviable. The Inside Room, moved by
      esoteric considerations, political and, more remotely, financial, had
      issued to him a managerial ukase; no police investigation if it could be
      avoided. Now, news was the guise in which Mr. Gordon sincerely worshiped
      Truth, the God. But Mammon, in the Inside Room, held the purse-strings Mr.
      Gordon had arrived at his honorable and well-paid position, not by wisdom
      alone, but also by compromise. Here was a situation where news must give
      way to the more essential interests of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that investigation will take a
      great deal of your time; more, I fear, than the paper can afford to give
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will arrange to put me on the stand in the mornings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further, any connection between a Ledger man and the Enderby
      Committee is undesirable and injudicious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; answered Banneker simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      said I&rsquo;d go through with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon selected a fresh knuckle for his modified drumming. &ldquo;Have
      you considered your duty to the paper, Mr. Banneker? If not, I advise you
      to do so.&rdquo; The careful manner, more than the words, implied threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker leaned forward as if for a confidential communication, as he
      lapsed into a gross Westernism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gordon, <i>I</i> am paying for this round of drinks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the managing editor received the impression that this remark,
      delivered in just that tone of voice and in its own proper environment,
      was usually accompanied by a smooth motion of the hand toward the pistol
      holster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, after asking whether there was anything more, and receiving a
      displeased shake of the head, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to the waiting Tommy Burt, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
      probably fire me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em! You can get plenty of other jobs. But I don&rsquo;t
      think they will. Old Gordon is really with you. It makes him sick to have
      to doctor news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleepless until almost morning, Banneker reviewed in smallest detail his
      decision and the situation to which it had led. He thought that he had
      taken the right course. He felt that Miss Camilla would approve. Judge
      Enderby&rsquo;s personality, he recognized, had exerted some influence
      upon his decision. He had conceived for the lawyer an instinctive respect
      and liking. There was about him a power of attraction, not readily
      definable, but seeming mysteriously to assert some hidden claim from the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where had he seen that fine and still face before?

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sequels of a surprising and diverse character followed Banneker&rsquo;s
      sudden fame. The first to manifest itself was disconcerting. On the
      Wednesday following the fight on the pier, Mrs. Brashear intercepted him
      in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we all admire what you did, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; she
      began, in evident trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of this eulogy murmured something deprecatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very brave of you. Most praiseworthy. We appreciate it, all
      of us. Yes, indeed. It&rsquo;s very painful, Mr. Banneker. I never
      expected to&mdash;to&mdash;indeed, I couldn&rsquo;t have believed&mdash;&rdquo;
      Mrs. Brashear&rsquo;s plump little hands made gestures so fluttery and
      helpless that her lodger was moved to come to her aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mrs. Brashear? What&rsquo;s troubling you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could make it convenient,&rdquo; said she tremulously,
      &ldquo;when your month is up. I shouldn&rsquo;t think of asking you
      before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you giving me notice?&rdquo; he inquired in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, please. The notoriety, the&mdash;the&mdash;your
      being arrested. You were arrested, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. But the coroner&rsquo;s jury cleared&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a thing never happened to any of my guests before. To have my
      house in the police records,&rdquo; wept Mrs. Brashear. &ldquo;Really, Mr.
      Banneker, really! You can&rsquo;t know how it hurts one&rsquo;s pride.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go next week,&rdquo; said the evicted one, divided
      between amusement and annoyance, and retired to escape another outburst of
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the matter was presented to him, he was rather glad to be
      leaving. Quarters somewhere in mid-town, more in consonance with his
      augmented income, suggested themselves as highly desirable. Since the
      affray he had been the object of irksome attentions from his fellow
      lodgers. It is difficult to say whether he found the more unendurable
      young Wickert&rsquo;s curiosity regarding details, Hainer&rsquo;s pompous
      adulation, or Lambert&rsquo;s admiring but jocular attitude. The others
      deemed it their duty never to refrain from some reference to the subject
      wherever and whenever they encountered him. The one exception was Miss
      Westlake. She congratulated him once, quietly but with warm sincerity; and
      when next she came to his door, dealt with another topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brashear tells me that you are leaving, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you why? That she has fired me out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, a little surprised and touched at the landlady&rsquo;s
      reticence, explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; commented Miss Westlake, &ldquo;you would soon
      have outgrown us in any case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. Where one lives doesn&rsquo;t so much
      matter. And I&rsquo;m a creature of habit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you are going to be a very big man, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; He smiled down at her. &ldquo;Now, why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer his smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got power,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;And you have mastered your medium&mdash;or gone far toward
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful for your good opinion,&rdquo; he began
      courteously; but she broke in on him, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were mine alone, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s the
      opinion of those who know. Mr. Banneker, I&rsquo;ve been taking a liberty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last person in the world to do that, I should
      think,&rdquo; he replied smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have. You may remember my asking you once when those little
      sketches that I retyped so often were to be published.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I never did anything with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. I showed them to Violet Thornborough. She is an old friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant of the publication world outside of Park Row, Banneker did not
      recognize a name, unknown to the public, which in the inner literary world
      connoted all that was finest, most perceptive, most discriminating and
      helpful in selective criticism. Miss Thornborough had been the first to
      see and foster half of the glimmering and feeble radiances which had later
      grown to be the manifest lights of the magazine and book world, thanks
      largely to her aid and encouragement. The next name mentioned by Miss
      Westlake was well enough known to Banneker, however. The critic, it
      appears, had, with her own hands, borne the anonymous, typed copies to the
      editorial sanctum of the foremost of monthlies, and, claiming a
      prerogative, refused to move aside from the pathway of orderly business
      until the Great Gaines himself, editor and autocrat of the publication,
      had read at least one of them. So the Great Gaines indulged Miss
      Thornborough by reading one. He then indulged himself by reading three
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your goose,&rdquo; he pronounced, &ldquo;is not fledged; but there
      may be a fringe of swan feathers. Bring him to see me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea of who, what, or where he is,&rdquo;
      answered the insistent critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hire a detective at our expense,&rdquo; smiled the editor.
      &ldquo;And, please, as you go, can&rsquo;t you lure away with you Mr.
      Harvey Wheelwright, our most popular novelist, now in the reception-room
      wishing us to publish his latest enormity? Us!&rdquo; concluded the Great
      Gaines sufficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having related the episode to its subject, Miss Westlake said diffidently:
      &ldquo;Do you think it was inexcusably impertinent of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I think it was very kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll go to see Mr. Gaines?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of these days. When I get out of this present scrape. And I
      hope you&rsquo;ll keep on copying my Sunday stuff after I leave. Nobody
      else would be so patient with my dreadful handwriting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a glance and a little flush of thankfulness. Matters had
      begun to improve with Miss Westlake. But it was due to Banneker that she
      had won through her time of desperation. Now, through his suggestion, she
      was writing successfully, quarter and half column &ldquo;general interest&rdquo;
      articles for the Woman&rsquo;s Page of the Sunday Ledger. If she could in
      turn help Banneker to recognition, part of her debt would be paid. As for
      him, he was interested in, but not greatly expectant of, the Gaines
      invitation. Still, if he were cast adrift from The Ledger because of
      activity in the coming police inquiry, there was a possible port in the
      magazine world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime there pressed the question of a home. Cressey ought to afford
      help on that. He called the gilded youth on the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old fire-eater!&rdquo; cried Cressey. &ldquo;Some little
      hero, aren&rsquo;t you! Bully work, my boy. I&rsquo;m proud to know
      you.... What; quarters? Easiest thing you know. I&rsquo;ve got the very
      thing&mdash;just like a real-estate agent. Let&rsquo;s see; this is your
      Monday at Sherry&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t it? All right. I&rsquo;ll meet you
      there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Providentially, as it might appear, a friend of Cressey&rsquo;s, having
      secured a diplomatic appointment, was giving up his bachelor apartment in
      the select and central Regalton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheap as dirt,&rdquo; said the enthusiastic Cressey, beaming at
      Banneker over his cocktail that evening. &ldquo;Two rooms and bath; fully
      furnished, and you can get it for eighteen hundred a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a raise from the five dollars a week I&rsquo;ve been paying,&rdquo;
      smiled Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! You&rsquo;ve got to live up to your new reputation. You&rsquo;re
      somebody, now, Banneker. All New York is talking about you. Why, I&rsquo;m
      afraid to say I know you for fear they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m bragging.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which doesn&rsquo;t increase my income,&rdquo; pointed out
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will. Just wait. One way or another you&rsquo;ll capitalize that
      reputation. That&rsquo;s the way New York is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way <i>I</i> am, however. I&rsquo;ll
      capitalize my brains and ability, if I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em; not my
      gun-play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gun-play will advertise your brains and ability, then,&rdquo;
      retorted Cressey. &ldquo;Nobody expects you to make a princely income
      shooting up toughs on the water-front. But your having done it will put
      you in the lime-light where people will notice you. And being noticed is
      the beginning of success in this-man&rsquo;s-town. I&rsquo;m not sure it
      isn&rsquo;t the end, too. Just see how the head waiter fell all over
      himself when you came in. I expect he&rsquo;s telling that bunch at the
      long table yonder who you are now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; returned Banneker comfortably, his long-bred habit
      of un-self-consciousness standing him in good stead. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
      all forget it soon enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he glanced over at the group around the table, the man who was
      apparently acting as host caught his eye and nodded in friendly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know Marrineal, do you?&rdquo; asked Cressey in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, but I&rsquo;ve never spoken to him. He dines
      sometimes in a queer little restaurant way downtown, just off the Swamp.
      Who is he, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puzzle. Nobody in the clubs knows him. He&rsquo;s a spender. Bit of
      a rounder, too, I expect. Plays the Street, and beats it, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the little beauty next him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a rising light of Park Row, and not know Betty Raleigh? She
      killed em dead in London in romantic comedy and now she&rsquo;s come back
      here to repeat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Opening to-night, isn&rsquo;t she? I&rsquo;ve got a seat.&rdquo;
      He looked over at Marrineal, who was apparently protesting against his
      neighbor&rsquo;s reversed wine-glass. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s
      little style of game, is it?&rdquo; He spoke crudely, for the apparition
      of the girl was quite touching in its youth, and delight, and candor of
      expression, whereas he had read into Marrineal&rsquo;s long, handsome, and
      blandly mature face a touch of the satyr. He resented the association.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Cressey promptly. &ldquo;If it
      is, he&rsquo;s in the wrong pew. Miss Raleigh is straight as they make
      &rsquo;em, from all I hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks it,&rdquo; admitted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that, she&rsquo;s in a rather sporty lot. Do you know that chap
      three seats to her left?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker considered the diner, a round-faced, high-colored, youthful man
      of perhaps thirty-five, with a roving and merry eye. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;I never saw him before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Del Eyre,&rdquo; remarked Cressey casually, and
      appearing not to look at Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of yours?&rdquo; The indifference of the tone indicated to
      his companion either that Banneker did not identify Delavan Eyre by his
      marriage, or that he maintained extraordinary control over himself, or
      that the queer, romantic stories of Io Welland&rsquo;s &ldquo;passion in
      the desert&rdquo; were gross exaggerations. Cressey inclined to the latter
      belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not specially,&rdquo; he answered the question. &ldquo;He belongs
      to a couple of my clubs. Everybody likes Del; even Mrs. Del. But his pace
      is too swift for me. Just at present he is furnishing transportation,
      sixty horse-power, for Tarantina, the dancer who is featured in Betty
      Raleigh&rsquo;s show.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she over there with them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. She wouldn&rsquo;t be. It isn&rsquo;t as sporty as all
      that.&rdquo; He rose to shake hands with a short, angular young man,
      dressed to a perfection as accurate as Banneker&rsquo;s own, and excelling
      him in one distinctive touch, a coat-flower of gold-and-white such as no
      other in New York could wear, since only in one conservatory was that
      special orchid successfully grown. By it Banneker recognized Poultney
      Masters, Jr., the son and heir of the tyrannous old financier who had for
      years bullied and browbeaten New York to his wayward old heart&rsquo;s
      content. In his son there was nothing of the bully, but through the
      amiability of manner Banneker could feel a quiet force. Cressey introduced
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just having coffee,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;Will
      you join us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I must go back to my party. I came over to express my
      personal obligation to you for cleaning out that gang of wharf-rats. My
      boat anchors off there. I hope to see you aboard her sometime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe me no thanks,&rdquo; returned Banneker good-humoredly.
      &ldquo;What I did was to save my own precious skin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The effect was the same. After this the rats will suspect every man
      of being a Banneker in disguise, and we shall have no more trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see!&rdquo; remarked Cressey triumphantly as Masters went away.
      &ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d arrived.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you count a word of ordinary courtesy as so much?&rdquo;
      inquired Banneker, surprised and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Junior? I certainly do. No Masters ever does anything without
      having figured out its exact meaning in advance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does this mean?&rdquo; asked the other, still unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing, that the Masters influence will be back of you, if
      the police try to put anything over. For another, that you&rsquo;ve got
      the broadest door to society open to you, if Junior follows up his hint
      about the yacht.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the time,&rdquo; returned Banneker with honest
      indifference. He sipped his coffee thoughtfully. &ldquo;Cressey,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;if I had a newspaper of my own in New York, do you know what
      I&rsquo;d do with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. But whether I did or not, I&rsquo;d set out to puncture
      that bubble of the Masters power and supremacy. It isn&rsquo;t right for
      any man to have that power just through money. It isn&rsquo;t American.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man would smash your paper in six months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. Maybe not. Nobody has ever taken a shot at him yet. He may
      be more vulnerable than he looks.... Speaking of money, I suppose I&rsquo;d
      better take that apartment. God knows how I&rsquo;ll pay for it,
      especially if I lose my job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you lose your job I&rsquo;ll get you a better one on Wall Street
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the strength of Poultney Masters, Jr., shaking hands with me, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically. It may not get into your newspapers, but the Street
      will know all about it to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer city. And it&rsquo;s a queer way to get on in
      it, by being quick on the trigger. Well, I&rsquo;m off for the theater.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Between acts, Banneker, walking out to get air, was conscious of being the
      object of comment and demonstration. He heard his name spoken in half
      whispers; saw nods and jerks of the head; was an involuntary eavesdropper
      upon a heated discussion; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No;
      it ain&rsquo;t. The paper says he&rsquo;s a big feller.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This
      guy ain&rsquo;t a reporter. Pipe his clothes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s
      big if you size him right. Look at his shoulders.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      betcha ten he ain&rsquo;t the man.&rdquo; And an apologetic young fellow
      ran after him to ask if he was not, in truth, Mr. Banneker of The Ledger.
      Being no more than human, he experienced a feeling of mild excitation over
      all this. But no sooner had the curtain risen on the second act than he
      quite forgot himself and his notoriety in the fresh charm of the comedy,
      and the delicious simplicity of Betty Raleigh as the heroine. That the
      piece was destined to success was plain, even so early. As the curtain
      fell again, and the star appeared, dragging after her a long, gaunt,
      exhausted, alarmed man in horn-rimmed spectacles, who had been lurking in
      a corner suffering from incipient nervous breakdown and illusions of
      catastrophe, he being the author, the body of the house rose and shouted.
      A hand fell on Banneker&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come behind at the finish?&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, Banneker met the cynical and near-sighted eyes of Gurney, The
      Ledger&rsquo;s dramatic critic, with whom he had merely a nodding
      acquaintance, as Gurney seldom visited the office except at off-hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Betty spotted you and has been demanding that the management
      bring you back for inspection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The play is a big success, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give it a year&rsquo;s run,&rdquo; returned the critic
      authoritatively. &ldquo;Laurence has written it to fit Raleigh like a
      glove. She&rsquo;s all they said of her in London. And when she left here
      a year ago, she was just a fairly good <i>ingénue</i>. However, she&rsquo;s
      got brains, which is the next best thing in the theatrical game to
      marriage with the manager&mdash;or near-marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, considering Gurney&rsquo;s crow-footed and tired leer, decided
      that he did not like the critic much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back-of-curtain after a successful opening provides a hectic and scrambled
      scene to the unaccustomed eye. Hastily presented to a few people, Banneker
      drifted to one side and, seating himself on a wire chair, contentedly
      assumed the role of onlooker. The air was full of laughter and greetings
      and kisses; light-hearted, offhand, gratulatory kisses which appeared to
      be the natural currency of felicitation. Betty Raleigh, lovely, flushed,
      and athrill with nervous exaltation, flung him a smile as she passed, one
      hand hooked in the arm of her leading man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming to supper with us later,&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ve got something to ask you.&rdquo; She spoke as
      one expectant of unquestioning obedience: this was her night of glory and
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether he had been previously bidden in through Gurney, or whether this
      chance word constituted his invitation, he did not know. Seeking
      enlightenment upon the point, he discovered that the critic had
      disappeared, to furnish his half-column for the morning issue. La
      Tarantina, hearing his inquiry, gave him the news in her broken English.
      The dancer, lithe, powerful, with the hideous feet and knotty legs typical
      of her profession, turned her somber, questioning eyes on the stranger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You air Monsieur Ban-kerr, who shoot, n&rsquo;est-ce-pas?&rdquo;
      she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Banneker,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel you be ver&rsquo; good an&rsquo; shoot sahmbody for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; he said, laughing; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
      plead for me with the jury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zen here he iss.&rdquo; She stretched a long and, as it seemed,
      blatantly naked arm into a group near by and drew forth the roundish man
      whom Cressey had pointed out at Marrineal&rsquo;s dinner party. &ldquo;He
      would be unfaithful to me, ziss one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Never!&rdquo; denied the accused. He set a kiss in the hollow of
      the dancer&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo;
      he added, holding out his hand. &ldquo;My name is Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yess!&rdquo; cried the dancer. &ldquo;He&mdash;what you say it?&mdash;he
      r-r-r-rave over Miss R-r-raleigh. He make me jealous. He shall be shoot at
      sunrice an&rsquo; I weel console me wiz his shooter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming programme!&rdquo; commented the doomed man. It struck
      Banneker that he had probably been drinking a good deal, also that he was
      a very likeable person, indeed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind my asking,
      where the devil did you learn to shoot like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, out West where I came from. I used to practice on the pine
      trees at a little water-tank station called Manzanita&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manzanita!&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; He
      swore softly, and stared at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was annoyed. Evidently the gossip of which Io&rsquo;s girl friend
      had hinted that other night at Sherry&rsquo;s had obtained wide currency.
      Before the conversation could go any further, even had it been likely to
      after that surprising check, one of the actors came over. He played the
      part of an ex-cowboy, who, in the bar-room scene, shot his way out of
      danger through a circle of gang-men, and he was now seeking from Banneker
      ostensibly pointers, actually praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, old man,&rdquo; he began without introduction. &ldquo;Gimme a
      tip or two. How do you get your hand over for your gun without giving
      yourself away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just dive for it, as you do in the play. You do it plenty quick
      enough. You&rsquo;d get the drop on me ten times out of ten,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker pleasantly, leaving the gratified actor with the
      conviction that he had been talking with the coming dramatic critic of the
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      For upwards of an hour there was carnival on the dismantling stage,
      mingled with the hurried toil of scene-shifters and the clean-up gang.
      Then the impromptu party began to disperse, Eyre going away with the
      dancer, after coming to bid Banneker good-night, with a look of veiled
      curiosity and interest which its object could not interpret. Banneker was
      gathered into the <i>corps intime</i> of Miss Raleigh&rsquo;s supper
      party, including the author of the play, an elderly first-nighter, two or
      three dramatic critics, Marrineal, who had drifted in, late, and half a
      dozen of the company. The men outnumbered the women, as is usual in such
      affairs, and Banneker found himself seated between the playwright and a
      handsome, silent girl who played with distinction the part of an elderly
      woman. There was wine in profusion, but he noticed that the player-folk
      drank sparingly. Condition, he correctly surmised, was part of their stock
      in trade. As it should be part of his also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the supper&rsquo;s course, there was a shifting of seats, and he
      was landed next to the star.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re bored stiff with talking about the shooting,&rdquo;
      she said, at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, rather. Wouldn&rsquo;t you be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Publicity is the breath of life to us,&rdquo; she laughed.
      &ldquo;You deal in it, so you don&rsquo;t care for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather shrewd in you. I&rsquo;m not sure that the
      logic is sound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m not going to bore you with your fame. But I want
      you to do something for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo; he said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How prettily you pay compliments! There is to be a police
      investigation, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you get me in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I want to come when you&rsquo;re on the stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great goodness! Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you want a reason,&rdquo; she answered mischievously,
      &ldquo;say that I want to bring good luck to your <i>première</i>, as you
      brought it to mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably make a sorry showing. Perhaps you would give me
      some training.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered in kind, and the acquaintanceship was progressing most
      favorably when a messenger of the theater manager&rsquo;s office staff
      appeared with early editions of the morning papers. Instantly every other
      interest was submerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me The Ledger,&rdquo; demanded Betty. &ldquo;I want to see
      what Gurney says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something pleasant surely,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;He told me
      that the play was an assured success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she read, Betty&rsquo;s vivacious face sparkled. Presently her
      expression changed. She uttered a little cry of disgust and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gurney is up to his smartnesses again,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Listen.
      Isn&rsquo;t this enraging!&rdquo; She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the play itself, it is formed, fashioned, and finished in
      the cleverest style of tailor-made, to Miss Raleigh&rsquo;s charming
      personality. One must hail Mr. Laurence as chief of our sartorial
      playwrights. No actress ever boasted a neater fit. Can you not picture
      him, all nice little enthusiasms and dainty devices, bustling about his
      fair patroness, tape in hand, mouth bristling with pins, smoothing out a
      wrinkle here, adjusting a line there, achieving his little <i>chef d&rsquo;oeuvre</i>
      of perfect tailoring? We have had playwrights who were blacksmiths,
      playwrights who were costumers, playwrights who were musical-boxes,
      playwrights who were, if I may be pardoned, garbage incinerators. It
      remained, for Mr. Laurence to show us what can be done with scissors,
      needle, and a nice taste in frills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s mean and shameful!&rdquo; proclaimed the reader
      in generous rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he gives you a splendid send-off, Miss Raleigh,&rdquo; said her
      leading man, who, reading over her shoulder, had discovered that he, too,
      was handsomely treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he does!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      a pig!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her manager, possessed of a second copy of The Ledger, now made a weighty
      contribution to the discussion. &ldquo;Just the same, this&rsquo;ll help
      sell out the house. It&rsquo;s full of stuff we can lift to paper the town
      with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicated several lines heartily praising Miss Raleigh and the cast,
      and one which, wrenched from its satirical context, was made to give an
      equally favorable opinion of the play. Something of Banneker&rsquo;s
      astonishment at this cavalier procedure must have been reflected in his
      face, for Marrineal, opposite, turned to him with a look of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your view of that, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; said Banneker promptly. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
      crooked. What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still quick on the trigger,&rdquo; murmured the other, but did not
      answer the return query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replies in profusion came from the rest, however. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      any crookeder than the review.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;D&rsquo;you call that
      fair criticism!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gurney! He hasn&rsquo;t an honest hair
      in his head.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Every other critic is strong for it; this
      is the only knock.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What did Laurence ever do to
      Gurney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the welter of angry voices came Betty Raleigh&rsquo;s clear speech,
      addressed to Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Banneker; I&rsquo;d forgotten that The Ledger
      is your paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, The Ledger ain&rsquo;t any worse than the rest of &rsquo;em,
      take it day in and day out,&rdquo; the manager remarked, busily penciling
      apposite texts for advertising, on the margin of Gurney&rsquo;s critique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; continued the star. &ldquo;A man spends
      a year working over a play&mdash;it was more than a year on this, wasn&rsquo;t
      it, Denny?&rdquo; she broke off to ask the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laurence nodded. He looked tired and a little bored, Banneker thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a critic has a happy thought and five minutes to think it over,
      and writes something mean and cruel and facetious, and perhaps undoes a
      whole year&rsquo;s work. Is that right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought to bar him from the theater,&rdquo; declared one of the
      women in the cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of <i>that</i>?&rdquo; inquired Marrineal,
      still addressing Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed. &ldquo;Admit only those who wear the bright and
      burnished badge of the Booster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that the idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody objects to honest criticism,&rdquo; began Betty Raleigh
      heatedly, and was interrupted by a mild but sardonic &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo;
      from one of the magazine reviewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest players don&rsquo;t object to honest criticism, then,&rdquo;
      she amended. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unfairness that hurts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which appears to be based on the assumption that it is
      impossible for Mr. Gurney honestly to have disliked Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s
      play,&rdquo; pointed out Banneker. &ldquo;Now, delightful as it seemed to
      me, I can conceive that to other minds&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he could honestly dislike it,&rdquo; put in the
      playwright hastily. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mean, slurring way he treated it,&rdquo; said the
      star &ldquo;Mr. Banneker, just what did he say to you about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly there leapt to his recollection the critic&rsquo;s words, at the
      close of the second act. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relief to listen for once to
      comedy that is sincere and direct.&rdquo; ... Then why, why&mdash;&ldquo;He
      said that you were all that the play required and the play was all that
      you required,&rdquo; he answered, which was also true, but another part of
      the truth. He was not minded to betray his associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rotten,&rdquo; murmured the manager, now busy on the
      margin of another paper. &ldquo;But I dunno as he&rsquo;s any rottener
      than the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On behalf of the profession of journalism, we thank you, Bezdek,&rdquo;
      said one of the critics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind old Bez,&rdquo; put in the elderly first-nighter.
      &ldquo;He always says what he thinks he means, but he usually doesn&rsquo;t
      mean it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perhaps just as well,&rdquo; said Banneker quite quietly,
      &ldquo;if he means that The Ledger is not straight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say The Ledger. I said Gurney. He&rsquo;s crooked as
      a corkscrew&rsquo;s hole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of protest and apprehension, for this was going rather
      too far, which Banneker&rsquo;s voice stilled. &ldquo;Just a minute. By
      that you mean that he takes bribes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw!&rdquo; snorted Bezdek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he&rsquo;s influenced by favoritism, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, did I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said either too little or too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can clear this up, I think,&rdquo; proffered the elderly
      first-nighter, in his courteous voice. &ldquo;Mr. Gurney is perhaps more
      the writer than the critic. He is carried away by the felicitous phrase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d rather be funny than fair,&rdquo; said Miss Raleigh
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curse of dramatic criticism,&rdquo; murmured a magazine
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten,&rdquo; said Bezdek doggedly. &ldquo;Crooked. Tryin&rsquo;
      to be funny at other folks&rsquo; expense. <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll give his tail
      a twist!&rdquo; By which he meant Mr. Gurney&rsquo;s printed words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of the high cult of honesty,&rdquo; remarked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The curse of all journalism,&rdquo; put in Laurence. &ldquo;The
      temptation to be effective at the expense of honesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of <i>that</i>?&rdquo; inquired the cheerful
      Marrineal, still directing his query to Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s rather a large order. Why do you keep asking my
      opinion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I suspect that you still bring a fresh mind to bear on
      these matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker rose, and bade Betty Raleigh good-night. She retained his hand in
      hers, looking up at him with a glint of anxiety in her weary, childlike
      eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what we&rsquo;ve said,&rdquo; she appealed
      to him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all a little above ourselves. It&rsquo;s always
      so after an opening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind at all,&rdquo; he returned gravely: &ldquo;unless
      it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s true right enough,&rdquo; she answered dispiritedly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about the investigation. And don&rsquo;t let
      them dare to put you on on a matinée day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Raleigh was a conspicuous figure, at not one but half a dozen
      sessions of the investigation, which wound through an accelerating and
      sensational course, with Banneker as the chief figure. He was an
      extraordinary witness, ready, self-possessed, good-humored under the
      heckling of the politician lawyer who had claimed and received the right
      to appear, on the ground that his police clients might be summoned later
      on a criminal charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the proceedings were over, a complete overturn in the city
      government was foreshadowed, and it became evident that Judge Enderby
      might either head the movement as its candidate, or control it as its
      leader. Nobody, however, knew what he wished or intended politically.
      Every now and again in the progress of the hearings, Banneker would
      surprise on the lawyer&rsquo;s face an expression which sent his memory
      questing fruitlessly for determination of that elusive likeness,
      flickering dimly in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s own role in the investigation kept him in the headlines;
      at times put him on the front page. Even The Ledger could only minimize,
      not suppress, his dominating and picturesque part.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another and less pleasant sequel to the shooting, in its
      effect upon the office status. Though he was a &ldquo;space-man&rdquo;
      now, dependent for his earnings upon the number of columns weekly which he
      had in the paper, and ostensibly equipped to handle matter of importance,
      a long succession of the pettiest kind of assignments was doled out to him
      by the city desk: obituary notices of insignificant people, small police
      items, tipsters&rsquo; yarns, routine jobs such as ship news, police
      headquarters substitution, even the minor courts usually relegated to the
      fifteen or twenty-dollar-a-week men. Or, worst and most grinding ordeal of
      a reporter&rsquo;s life, he was kept idle at his desk, like a misbehaving
      boy after school, when all the other men had been sent out. One week his
      total space came to but twenty-eight dollars odd. What this meant was
      plain enough; he was being disciplined for his part in the investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the open West which, under the rigor of the game, keeps its temper
      and its poise, Banneker had brought the knack of setting his teeth and
      smiling so serenely that one never even perceived the teeth to be set
      behind the smile. This ability stood him in good stead now. In his time of
      enforced leisure he bethought himself of the sketches which Miss Westlake
      had typed. With his just and keen perception, he judged them not to be
      magazine matter. But they might do as &ldquo;Sunday stuff.&rdquo; He
      turned in half a dozen of them to Mr. Homans. When next he saw them they
      were lying, in uncorrected proof, on the managing editor&rsquo;s desk
      while Mr. Gordon gently rapped his knuckles over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get the idea for these, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It came to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care to sign them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign them?&rdquo; repeated the reporter in surprise, for this was a
      distinction afforded to only a choice few on the conservative Ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m going to run them on the editorial page. Do us some
      more and keep them within the three-quarters. What&rsquo;s your full name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sign them &lsquo;Eban,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered the
      other, after some thought. &ldquo;And thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Assignments or no assignments, thereafter Banneker was able to fill his
      idle time. Made adventurous by the success of the &ldquo;Vagrancies,&rdquo;
      he next tried his hand at editorials on light or picturesque topics, and
      with satisfying though not equal results, for here he occasionally
      stumbled upon the hard-rooted prejudices of the Inside Office, and beheld
      his efforts vanish into the irreclaimable limbo of the scrap-basket.
      Nevertheless, at ten dollars per column for this kind of writing, he
      continued to make a decent space bill, and clear himself of the doldrums
      where the waning of the city desk&rsquo;s favor had left him. All that he
      could now make he needed, for his change of domicile had brought about a
      corresponding change of habit and expenditure into which he slipped
      imperceptibly. To live on fifteen dollars a week, plus his own small
      income, which all went for &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; had been simple, at Mrs.
      Brashear&rsquo;s. To live on fifty at the Regalton was much more of a
      problem. Banneker discovered that he was a natural spender. The discovery
      caused him neither displeasure nor uneasiness. He confidently purposed to
      have money to spend; plenty of it, as a mere, necessary concomitant to
      other things that he was after. Good reporters on space, working
      moderately, made from sixty to seventy-five dollars a week. Banneker set
      himself a mark of a hundred dollars. He intended to work very hard ... if
      Mr. Greenough would give him a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s distribution of the day&rsquo;s news continued to be
      distinctly unfavorable to the new space-man. The better men on the staff
      began to comment on the city desk&rsquo;s discrimination. Banneker had,
      for a time, shone in heroic light: his feat had been honorable, not only
      to The Ledger office, but to the entire craft of reporting. In the
      investigation he had borne himself with unexceptionable modesty and
      equanimity. That he should be &ldquo;picked on&rdquo; offended that
      generous <i>esprit de corps</i> which was natural to the office. Tommy
      Burt was all for referring the matter to Mr. Gordon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mind your own business, Tommy,&rdquo; said Banneker placidly.
      &ldquo;Our friend the Joss will stick his foot into a gopher hole yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The assignment that afforded Banneker his chance was of the most
      unpromising. An old builder, something of a local character over in the
      Corlears Hook vicinity, had died. The Ledger, Mr. Greenough informed
      Banneker, in his dry, polite manner, wanted &ldquo;a sufficient obit&rdquo;
      of the deceased. Banneker went to the queer, decrepit frame cottage at the
      address given, and there found a group of old Sam Corpenshire&rsquo;s
      congeners, in solemn conclave over the dead. They welcomed the reporter,
      and gave him a ceremonial drink of whiskey, highly superior whiskey. They
      were glad that he had come to write of their dead friend. If ever a man
      deserved a good write-up, it was Sam Corpenshire. From one mouth to
      another they passed the word of his shrewd dealings, of his good-will to
      his neighbors, of his ripe judgment, of his friendliness to all sound
      things and sound men, of his shy, sly charities, of the thwarted romance,
      which, many years before, had left him lonely but unembittered; and out of
      it Banneker, with pen too slow for his eager will, wove not a two-stick
      obit, but a rounded column shot through with lights that played upon the
      little group of characters, the living around the dead, like sunshine upon
      an ancient garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Greenough congratulated Banneker, the next morning. In the
      afternoon mail came a note from Mr. Gaines of The New Era monthly. That
      perspicuous editor had instantly identified the style of the article with
      that of the &ldquo;Eban&rdquo; series, part of which he had read in
      typograph. He wrote briefly but warmly of the work: and would the writer
      not call and see him soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the reporter might have accepted the significant invitation
      promptly, as he at first intended. But on the following morning he found
      in his box an envelope under French stamp, inscribed with writing which,
      though he had seen but two specimens of it, drove everything else out of
      his tumultuous thoughts. He took it, not to his desk, but to a side room
      of the art department, unoccupied at that hour, and opened it with chilled
      and fumbling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within was a newspaper clipping, from a Paris edition of an American
      daily. It gave a brief outline of the battle on the pier. In pencil on the
      margin were these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember practicing, that day, among the pines? I&rsquo;m so
      proud! Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it again. The last sentence affected him with a sensation of
      dizziness. Proud! Of his deed! It gave him the feeling that she had
      reclaimed, reappropriated him. No! That she had never for a moment
      released him. In a great surge, sweeping through his veins, he felt the
      pressure of her breast against his, the strong enfoldment of her arms, her
      breath upon his lips. He tore envelope and clipping into fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one of those strange associations of linked memory, such as &ldquo;clangs
      and flashes for a drowning man,&rdquo; he sharply recalled where he had
      seen Willis Enderby before. His was the face in the photograph to which
      Camilla Van Arsdale had turned when death stretched out a hand toward her.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the police inquiry was afoot, Banneker was, perforce, often late in
      reporting for duty, the regular hour being twelve-thirty. Thus the
      idleness which the city desk had imposed upon him was, in a measure,
      justified. On a Thursday, when he had been held in conference with Judge
      Enderby, he did not reach The Ledger office until after two. Mr. Greenough
      was still out for luncheon. No sooner had Banneker entered the swinging
      gate than Mallory called to him. On the assistant city editor&rsquo;s face
      was a peculiar expression, half humorous, half dubious, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Greenough has left an assignment for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Banneker, stretching out his hand for the
      clipping or slip. None was forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tip,&rdquo; explained Mallory. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from
      a pretty convincing source. The gist of it is that the Delavan Eyres have
      separated and a divorce is impending. You know, of course, who the Eyres
      are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Ever met his wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Banneker, in good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you wouldn&rsquo;t have, probably. They travel different paths.
      Besides, she&rsquo;s been practically living abroad. She&rsquo;s a
      stunner. It&rsquo;s big society stuff, of course. The best chance of
      landing the story is from Archie Densmore, her half-brother. The
      international polo-player, you know. You&rsquo;ll find him at The Retreat,
      down on the Jersey coast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Retreat Banneker had heard of as being a bachelor country club whose
      distinguishing marks were a rather Spartan athleticism, and a more stiffly
      hedged exclusiveness than any other social institution known to the <i>élite</i>
      of New York and Philadelphia, between which it stood midway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m to go and ask him,&rdquo; said Banneker slowly,
      &ldquo;whether his sister is suing for divorce?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; confirmed Mallory, a trifle nervously. &ldquo;Find out
      who&rsquo;s to be named, of course. I suppose it&rsquo;s that new dancer,
      though there have been others. And there was a quaint story about some
      previous attachment of Mrs. Eyre&rsquo;s: that might have some bearing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to ask her brother about that, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want the story,&rdquo; answered Mallory, almost petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trip down into Jersey the reporter had plenty of time to consider
      his unsavory task. Some one had to do this kind of thing, so long as the
      public snooped and peeped and eavesdropped through the keyhole of print at
      the pageant of the socially great: this he appreciated and accepted. But
      he felt that it ought to be some one other than himself&mdash;and, at the
      same time, was sufficiently just to smile at himself for his illogical
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surprisingly good auto was found in the town of his destination, to
      speed him to the stone gateway of The Retreat. The guardian, always on
      duty there, passed him with a civil word, and a sober-liveried flunkey at
      the clubhouse door, after a swift, unobtrusive consideration of his
      clothes and bearing, took him readily for granted, and said that Mr.
      Densmore would be just about going on the polo field for practice. Did the
      gentleman know his way to the field? Seeing the flag on the stable,
      Banneker nodded, and walked over. A groom pointed out a spare, powerful
      looking young man with a pink face, startlingly defined by a straight
      black mustache and straighter black eyebrows, mounting a light-built roan,
      a few rods away. Banneker accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my name is Densmore,&rdquo; he answered the visitor&rsquo;s
      accost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter from The Ledger,&rdquo; explained Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter?&rdquo; Mr. Densmore frowned. &ldquo;Reporters aren&rsquo;t
      allowed here, except on match days. How did you get in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody stopped me,&rdquo; answered the visitor in an expressionless
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;re
      here. What is it; the international challenge?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rumor has come to us&mdash;There&rsquo;s a tip come in at the
      office&mdash;We understood that there is&mdash;&rdquo; Banneker pulled
      himself together and put the direct question. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Delavan Eyre
      bringing a divorce suit against her husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time there was a measured silence. Mr. Densmore&rsquo;s heavy brows
      seemed to jut outward and downward toward the questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came out here from New York to ask me that?&rdquo; he said
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Who is named as co-respondent? And will there be a defense, or
      a counter-suit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A counter-suit,&rdquo; repeated the man in the saddle quietly.
      &ldquo;I wonder if you realize what you&rsquo;re asking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get the news,&rdquo; said Banneker doggedly
      striving to hold to an ideal which momentarily grew more sordid and
      tawdry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wonder if you realize how you ought to be answered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Banneker realized, with a sick realization. But he was not going to
      admit it. He kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this polo mallet were a whip, now,&rdquo; observed Mr. Densmore
      meditatively. &ldquo;A dog-whip, for preference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the shameful threat Banneker&rsquo;s eyes lightened. Here at least
      was something he could face like a man. His undermining nausea mitigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; he inquired in tones as level as those of his
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then I&rsquo;d put a mark on you. A reporter&rsquo;s mark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; you think not?&rdquo; The horseman studied him negligently.
      Trained to the fineness of steel in the school of gymnasium, field, and
      tennis court, he failed to recognize in the man before him a type as
      formidable, in its rugged power, as his own. &ldquo;Or perhaps I&rsquo;d
      have the grooms do it for me, before they threw you over the fence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be safer,&rdquo; allowed the other, with a smile that
      surprised the athlete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safer?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of
      safety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it,&rdquo; advised the visitor; &ldquo;for if you set your
      grooms on me, they could perhaps throw me out. But as sure as they did I&rsquo;d
      kill you the next time we met.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Densmore smiled. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said contemptuously. &ldquo;Kill,
      eh? Did you ever kill any one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under their jet brows Densmore&rsquo;s eyes took on a peculiar look of
      intensity. &ldquo;A Ledger reporter,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;See here!
      Is your name Banneker, by any chance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the man who cleared out the wharf-gang.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Densmore had been born and brought up in a cult to which courage is the
      basic, inclusive virtue for mankind, as chastity is for womankind. To his
      inground prejudice a man who was simply and unaffectedly brave must by
      that very fact be fine and admirable. And this man had not only shown an
      iron nerve, but afterward, in the investigation, which Densmore had
      followed, he had borne himself with the modesty, discretion, and good
      taste of the instinctive gentleman. The poloist was almost pathetically at
      a loss. When he spoke again his whole tone and manner had undergone a
      vital transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good God!&rdquo; he cried in real distress and bewilderment,
      &ldquo;a fellow who could do what you did, stand up to those gun-men in
      the dark and alone, to be garbaging around asking rotten, prying questions
      about a man&rsquo;s sister! No! I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker felt the blood run up into his face, under the sting of the other&rsquo;s
      puzzled protest, as it would never have done under open contempt or
      threat. A miserable, dull hopelessness possessed him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      part of the business,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a rotten business,&rdquo; retorted the horseman.
      &ldquo;Do you <i>have</i> to do this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has to get the news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News! Scavenger&rsquo;s filth. See here, Banneker, I&rsquo;m sorry
      I roughed you about the whip. But, to ask a man questions about the women
      of his own family&mdash;No: I&rsquo;m <i>damned</i> if I get it.&rdquo; He
      lost himself in thought, and when he spoke again it was as much to himself
      as to the man on the ground. &ldquo;Suppose I did make a frank statement:
      you can never trust the papers to get it straight, even if they mean to,
      which is doubtful. And there&rsquo;s Io&rsquo;s name smeared all over&mdash;Hel-lo!
      What&rsquo;s the matter, now?&rdquo; For his horse had shied away from an
      involuntary jerk of Banneker&rsquo;s muscles, responsive to electrified
      nerves, so sharply as to disturb the rider&rsquo;s balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo; muttered Banneker, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io. My foster-sister&rsquo;s nickname. Irene Welland, she was. You&rsquo;re
      a queer sort of society reporter if you don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a society reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know Mrs. Eyre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in a way,&rdquo; returned Banneker, gaining command of
      himself. &ldquo;Officially, you might say. She was in a railroad wreck
      that I stage-managed out West. I was the local agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve heard about you,&rdquo; replied Densmore with
      interest, though he had heard only what little Io had deemed it advisable
      that he should know. &ldquo;You helped my sister when she was hurt. We owe
      you something for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Official duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. But it was more than that. I recall your
      name now.&rdquo; Densmore&rsquo;s bearing had become that of a man to his
      equal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, let&rsquo;s go up to the clubhouse and
      have a drink, shan&rsquo;t we? D&rsquo; you mind just waiting here while I
      give this nag a little run to supple him up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was off, leaving Banneker with brain awhirl. To steady himself against
      this sudden flood of memory and circumstance, Banneker strove to focus his
      attention upon the technique of the horse and his rider. When they
      returned he said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to play that pony?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The horseman looked mildly surprised. &ldquo;After he&rsquo;s learned a
      bit more. Shapes up well, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speed him up to me and give him a sharp twist to the right, will
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accepting the suggestion without comment, Densmore cantered away and
      brought the roan down at speed. To the rider, his mount seemed to make the
      sudden turn perfectly. But Banneker stepped out and examined the off
      forefoot with a dubious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breaks a little there,&rdquo; he stated seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horseman tried the turn again, throwing his weight over. This time he
      did feel a slightly perceptible &ldquo;give.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      the remedy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Build up the outer flange of the shoe. That may do it. But I
      shouldn&rsquo;t trust him without a thorough test. A good pony&rsquo;ll
      always overplay his safety a little in a close match.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The implication of this expert view aroused Densmore&rsquo;s curiosity.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve played,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: I&rsquo;ve never played. I&rsquo;ve knocked the ball about a
      little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out in Santa Barbara. With the stable-boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So simply was it said that Densmore returned, quite as simply: &ldquo;Were
      you a stable-boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck, then. Just a kid, out of a job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Densmore dismounted, handed reins and mallet to the visitor and said,
      &ldquo;Try a shot or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping his coat and waistcoat, Banneker mounted and urged the pony after
      the ball which the other sent spinning out across the field. He made a
      fairly creditable cut away to the left, following down and playing back
      moderately. While his mallet work was, naturally, uncertain, he played
      with a full, easy swing and in good form. But it was his horsemanship
      which specially commended itself to the critical eye of the connoisseur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridden range, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; inquired the poloist when
      the other came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a bit of it, in my time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Densmore, employing his
      favorite formula. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be practice later. It&rsquo;s an
      off day and we probably won&rsquo;t have two full teams. Let me rig you
      out, and you try it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on business. I&rsquo;m a
      reporter with a story to get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; it&rsquo;s up to a reporter to stick until he gets his
      news,&rdquo; agreed the other. &ldquo;You dismiss your taxi, and stay out
      here and dine, and I&rsquo;ll run you back to town myself. And at nine o&rsquo;clock
      I&rsquo;ll answer your question and answer it straight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, gazing longingly at the bright turf of the field, accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polo is to The Retreat what golf is to the average country club. The news
      that Archie Densmore had a new player down for a try-out brought to the
      side-lines a number of the old-time followers of the game, including
      Poultney Masters, the autocrat of Wall Street and even more of The
      Retreat, whose stables he, in large measure, supported. In the third
      period, the stranger went in at Number Three on the pink team. He played
      rather poorly, but there was that in his style which encouraged the
      enthusiasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s material,&rdquo; grunted old Masters, blinking his
      pendulous eyelids, as Banneker, accepting the challenge of Jim Maitland,
      captain of the opposing team and roughest of players, for a ride-off,
      carried his own horse through by sheer adroitness and daring, and left the
      other rolling on the turf. &ldquo;Anybody know who he is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard Archie call him Banker, I think,&rdquo; answered one of the
      great man&rsquo;s hangers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Banneker having changed, sat in an angled window of the clubhouse,
      waiting for his host, who had returned from the stables. A group of
      members entering the room, and concealed from him by an L, approached the
      fireplace talking briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick says the feller&rsquo;s a reporter,&rdquo; declared one of
      them, a middle-aged man named Kirke. &ldquo;Says he saw him tryin&rsquo;
      to interview somebody on the Street, one day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; announced an elderly member.
      &ldquo;This chap of Densmore&rsquo;s looks like a gentleman and dresses
      like one. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a reporter. And he rides like a
      devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> say there&rsquo;s ridin&rsquo; and ridin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
      proclaimed Kirke. &ldquo;Some fellers ride like jockeys; some fellers ride
      like cowboys; some fellers ride like gentlemen. I say this reporter feller
      don&rsquo;t ride like a gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, slush!&rdquo; said another discourteously. &ldquo;What is
      riding like a gentleman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirke reverted to the set argument of his type. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll betcha a
      hundred he don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to settle such a bet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to Maitland,&rdquo; said somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to Archie Densmore if you like,&rdquo; offered
      the bettor belligerently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to Mr. Masters,&rdquo; suggested Kirke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not leave it to the horse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion, coming in a level and unconcerned tone from the depths of
      the chair in which Banneker was seated, produced an electrical effect.
      Banneker spoke only because the elderly member had walked over to the
      window, and he saw that he must be discovered in another moment. Out of
      the astonished silence came the elderly member&rsquo;s voice, gentle and
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the visitor we have been so frankly discussing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assume so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather unfortunate that you did not make your
      presence known sooner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped that I might have a chance to slip out unseen and save you
      embarrassment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other came forward at once with hand outstretched. &ldquo;My name is
      Forster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Banker, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Banneker, shaking hands. For various reasons it
      did not seem worth while to correct the slight error.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out! Here&rsquo;s the old man,&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poultney Masters plodded in, his broad paunch shaking with chuckles.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Leave it to the horse,&rsquo;&rdquo; he mumbled
      appreciatively. &ldquo;&lsquo;Leave it to the horse.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s
      good. It&rsquo;s damned good. The right answer. Who but the horse should
      know whether a man rides like a gentleman! Where&rsquo;s young Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Forster introduced the two. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the makings of a
      polo-man in you,&rdquo; decreed the great man. &ldquo;Where are you
      playing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never really played. Just practiced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be with us. Where&rsquo;s Densmore? We&rsquo;ll
      put you up and have you in by the next meeting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reporter in The Retreat!&rdquo; protested Kirke who had proffered
      the bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; snapped old Poultney Masters. &ldquo;Got any
      objections?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the making or marring of his fortunes, like those of hundreds of
      other men, lay in the pudgy hollow of the financier&rsquo;s hand, poor
      Kirke had no objections which he could not and did not at once swallow.
      The subject of the flattering offer had, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t
      join this club. Can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford not to. It&rsquo;s a chance not many young
      fellows from nowhere get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know what a reporter&rsquo;s earnings are,
      Mr. Masters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the group had drifted away, in obedience, Banneker suspected,
      to some indication given by Masters which he had not perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be a reporter long. Opportunities will open out for
      a young fellow of your kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of opportunities?&rdquo; inquired Banneker curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall Street, for example.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like the game. Writing is my line. I&rsquo;m
      going to stick to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; barked Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a word I don&rsquo;t take from anybody,&rdquo; stated
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t take? Who the&mdash;&rdquo; The raucous
      snarl broke into laughter, as the other leaned abruptly forward. &ldquo;Banneker,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;have you got <i>me</i> covered?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed, too. Despite his brutal assumption of autocracy, it was
      impossible not to like this man. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t expect to be held up here. So I left my gun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did a job on that pier,&rdquo; affirmed the other. &ldquo;But
      you&rsquo;re a fool just the same&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll take it with a
      smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; answered Banneker, as Densmore
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see me at the office,&rdquo; invited Masters as he
      shambled pursily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the dining-table Densmore said to his guest: &ldquo;So the Old Boy
      wants to put you up here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means a sure election.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if I could afford it, I&rsquo;d get very little use of the
      club. You see, I have only one day off a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a rotten business, for sure!&rdquo; said Densmore
      sympathetically. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get on night work, so you could
      play afternoons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play polo?&rdquo; Banneker laughed. &ldquo;My means would hardly
      support one pony.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; returned the other nonchalantly.
      &ldquo;There are always fellows glad to lend a mount to a good player. And
      you&rsquo;re going to be that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The high lust of the game took and shook Banneker for a dim moment. Then
      he recovered himself. &ldquo;No. I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave it this way, then. Whether you join now or not,
      come down once in a while as my guest, and fill in for the scratch
      matches. Later you may be able to pick up a few nags, cheap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; said Banneker, as he had said to
      old Poultney Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until after the dinner did Banneker remind his host of their
      understanding. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten that I&rsquo;m here on
      business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to answer your question for
      publication. Mrs. Eyre has not the slightest intention of suing for
      divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the separation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No separation, either. Io is traveling with friends and will be
      back in a few months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is authoritative?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can quote me, if you like, though I&rsquo;d rather nothing were
      published, of course. And I give you my personal word that it&rsquo;s
      true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for publication. What follows is private: just between you
      and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker nodded. After a ruminative pause Densmore asked an abrupt
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found my sister after the wreck, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; she found me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. There was some concussion of the brain, I suppose. She
      was quite dazed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you call a doctor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She wouldn&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Miss Van Arsdale, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the best friend I&rsquo;ve got in the world,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker, so impulsively that his interrogator looked at him
      curiously before continuing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Io at her house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; frequently,&rdquo; replied Banneker, wondering to what this
      all tended, but resolved to be as frank as was compatible with discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she seem?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was as well off there as she could be anywhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But how did she seem? Mentally, I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that! The dazed condition cleared up at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were sure that it had ever cleared up,&rdquo; muttered
      Densmore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you be sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be frank with you because I think you may be
      able to help me with a clue. Since she came back from the West, Io has
      been unlike herself. The family has never understood her marriage with Del
      Eyre. She didn&rsquo;t really care for Del. [To his dismay, Banneker here
      beheld the glowing tip of his cigar perform sundry involuntary dips and
      curves. He hoped that his face was under better control.] The marriage was
      a fizzle. I don&rsquo;t believe it lasted a month, really. Eyre had always
      been a chaser, though he did straighten out when he married Io. He really
      was crazy about her; but when she chucked him, he went back to his old
      hunting grounds. One can understand that. But Io; that&rsquo;s different.
      She&rsquo;s always played the game before. With Del, I don&rsquo;t think
      she quite did. She quit: that&rsquo;s the plain fact of it. Just tired of
      him. No other cause that I can find. Won&rsquo;t get a divorce. Doesn&rsquo;t
      want it. So there&rsquo;s no one else in the case. It&rsquo;s queer. It&rsquo;s
      mighty queer. And I can&rsquo;t help thinking that the old jar to her
      brain&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you suggested that to her?&rdquo; asked Banneker as the other
      broke off to ruminate mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She only laughed. Then she said that poor old Del wasn&rsquo;t
      at fault except for marrying her in the face of a warning. I don&rsquo;t
      know what she meant by it; hanged if I do. But, you see, it&rsquo;s quite
      true: there&rsquo;ll be no divorce or separation.... You&rsquo;re sure she
      was quite normal when you last saw her at Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. If you want confirmation, why not write Miss Van
      Arsdale yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I hardly think I&rsquo;ll do that.... Now as to that gray you
      rode, I&rsquo;ve got a chance to trade him.&rdquo; And the talk became all
      of horse, which is exclusive and rejective of other interests, even of
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back in the train, Banneker reviewed the crowding events of the day.
      At the bottom of his thoughts lay a residue, acid and stinging, the shame
      of the errand which had taken him to The Retreat, and which the memory of
      what was no less than a personal triumph could not submerge. That he,
      Errol Banneker, whose dealings with all men had been on the straight and
      level status of self-respect, should have taken upon him the ignoble task
      of prying into intimate affairs, of meekly soliciting the most private
      information in order that he might make his living out of it&mdash;not
      different in kind from the mendicancy which, even as a hobo, he had
      scorned&mdash;and that, at the end, he should have discerned Io Welland as
      the object of his scandal-chase; that fermented within him like something
      turned to foulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office he reported &ldquo;no story.&rdquo; Before going home he
      wrote a note to the city desk.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Impenetrability of expression is doubtless a valuable attribute to a joss.
      Otherwise so many josses would not display it. Upon the stony and placid
      visage of Mr. Greenough, never more joss-like than when, on the morning
      after Banneker went to The Retreat, he received the resultant note, the
      perusal thereof produced no effect. Nor was there anything which might
      justly be called an expression, discernible between Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s
      cloven chin-tip and Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s pale fringe of hair, when, as
      Banneker entered the office at noon, he called the reporter to him.
      Banneker&rsquo;s face, on the contrary, displayed a quite different
      impression; that of amiability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the Eyre story, Mr. Banneker!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Mr. Densmore?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he talk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he made a statement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t appear in the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing to it but unqualified denial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; I see. That&rsquo;s all, Mr. Banneker.... Oh, by the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, who had set out for his desk, turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a note from you this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As this statement required no confirmation, Banneker gave it none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Containing your resignation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conditional upon my being assigned to pry into society or private
      scandals or rumors of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ledger does not recognize conditional resignation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s smile was as sunny and
      untroubled as a baby&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you appreciate that some one must cover this kind of
      news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It will have to be some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The faintest, fleeting suspicion of a frown troubled the Brahminical calm
      of Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s brow, only to pass into unwrinkled blandness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further, you will recognize that, for the protection of the paper,
      I must have at call reporters ready to perform any emergency duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; agreed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; queried Mr. Greenough in a semi-purr, &ldquo;are
      you too good for your job?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For once the personification of city-deskness, secure though he was in the
      justice of his position, was discomfited. &ldquo;Too good for The Ledger?&rdquo;
      he demanded in protest and rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me put it this way; I&rsquo;m too good for any job that won&rsquo;t
      let me look a man square between the eyes when I meet him on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dull lot of newspapers we&rsquo;d have if all reporters took that
      view,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Greenough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me that what you&rsquo;ve just said is the severest kind
      of an indictment of the whole business, then,&rdquo; retorted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A business that is good enough for a good many first-class men,
      even though you may not consider it so for you. Possibly being for the
      time&mdash;for a brief time&mdash;a sort of public figure, yourself, has&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all to do with it,&rdquo; interrupted the urbane
      reporter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been this way. It was born in me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall consult with Mr. Gordon about this,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Greenough, becoming joss-like again. &ldquo;I hardly think&mdash;&rdquo;
      But what it was that he hardly thought, the subject of his animadversions
      did not then or subsequently ascertain, for he was dismissed in the middle
      of the sentence with a slow, complacent nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loss of his place, had it promptly followed, would not have dismayed the
      rebel. It did not follow. Nothing followed. Nothing, that is, out of the
      ordinary run. Mr. Gordon said no word. Mr. Greenough made no reference to
      the resignation. Tommy Burt, to whom Banneker had confided his action, was
      of opinion that the city desk was merely waiting &ldquo;to hand you
      something so raw that you&rsquo;ll have to buck it; something that not
      even Joe Bullen would take.&rdquo; Joe Bullen, an undertaker&rsquo;s
      assistant who had drifted into journalism through being a tipster, was The
      Ledger&rsquo;s &ldquo;keyhole reporter&rdquo; (unofficial).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joss is just tricky enough for that,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
      want to put you in the wrong with Gordon. You&rsquo;re a pet of the boss&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Greenough,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;If you
      were on the desk you wouldn&rsquo;t want reporters that wouldn&rsquo;t
      take orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Cleve, oldest in standing of any of the staff, approached Banneker
      with a grave face and solemn warnings. To leave The Ledger was to depart
      forever from the odor of journalistic sanctity. No other office in town
      was endurable for a gentleman. Other editors treated their men like
      muckers. The worst assignment given out from The Ledger desk was a
      perfumed cinch in comparison with what the average city room dealt out.
      And he gave a formidable sketch of the careers (invariably downhill) of
      reckless souls who had forsaken the true light of The Ledger for the false
      lures which led into outer and unfathomable darkness. By this system of
      subtly threatened excommunication had The Ledger saved to itself many a
      good man who might otherwise have gone farther and not necessarily fared
      worse. Banneker was not frightened. But he did give more than a thought to
      the considerate standards and generous comradeship of the office. Only&mdash;was
      it worth the price in occasional humiliation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting, idle at his desk in one of the subsequent periods of penance, he
      bethought him of the note on the stationery of The New Era Magazine,
      signed, &ldquo;Yours very truly, Richard W. Gaines.&rdquo; Perhaps this
      was opportunity beckoning. He would go to see the Great Gaines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Gaines received him with quiet courtesy. He was a stubby, thick,
      bearded man who produced an instant effect of entire candor. So peculiar
      and exotic was this quality that it seemed to set him apart from the genus
      of humankind in an aura of alien and daunting honesty. Banneker recalled
      hearing of outrageous franknesses from his lips, directed upon small and
      great, and, most amazingly, accepted without offense, because of the
      translucent purity of the medium through which, as it were, the inner
      prophet had spoken. Besides, he was usually right.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first words to Banneker, after his greeting, were: &ldquo;You are
      exceedingly well tailored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; asked Banneker, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed. I had read into your writing midnight toil
      and respectable, if seedy, self-support.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the best Grub Street tradition? Park Row has outlived that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your tailor, but what&rsquo;s your college?&rdquo; inquired
      this surprising man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I was right in that. I surmised individual education. Who
      taught you to think for yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommon name. You&rsquo;re not a son of Christian
      Banneker, perhaps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Did you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mistaken man. Whoring after strange gods. Strange, sterile, and
      disappointing. But a brave soul, nevertheless. Yes; I knew him well. What
      did he teach you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried to teach me to stand on my own feet and see with my own
      eyes and think for myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! With one&rsquo;s own eyes. So much depends upon whither
      one turns them. What have you seen in daily journalism?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance. Possibly a great chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think for yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker started, at this ready application of his words to the problem
      which was already outlining itself by small, daily limnings in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To write for others what you think for yourself?&rdquo; pursued the
      editor, giving sharpness and definition to the outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Gaines, as his hearer preserved silence,
      &ldquo;eventually to write for others what they think for themselves?&rdquo;
      He smiled luminously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a problem in stress: <i>x</i> =
      the breaking-point of honesty. Your father was an absurdly honest man.
      Those of us who knew him best honored him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you doubting my honesty?&rdquo; inquired Banneker, without
      resentment or challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Anybody&rsquo;s. But hopefully, you understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the honesty of the newspaper business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh ruffled the closer tendrils of Mr. Gaines&rsquo;s beard. &ldquo;I
      have never been a journalist in the Park Row sense,&rdquo; he said
      regretfully. &ldquo;Therefore I am conscious of solutions of continuity in
      my views. Park Row amazes me. It also appalls me. The daily stench that
      arises from the printing-presses. Two clouds; morning and evening....
      Perhaps it is only the odor of the fertilizing agent, stimulating the
      growth of ideas. Or is it sheer corruption?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two stages of the same process, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; suggested
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encouraging to think so. Yet labor in a fertilizing plant, though
      perhaps essential, is hardly conducive to higher thinking. You like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t accept your definition at all,&rdquo; replied
      Banneker. &ldquo;The newspapers are only a medium. If there is a stench,
      they do not originate it. They simply report the events of the day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. They simply disseminate it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was annoyed at himself for flushing. &ldquo;They disseminate
      news. We&rsquo;ve got to have news, to carry on the world. Only a small
      fraction of it is&mdash;well, malodorous. Would you destroy the whole
      system because of one flaw? You&rsquo;re not fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair? Of course I&rsquo;m not. How should I be? No; I would not
      destroy the system. Merely deodorize it a bit. But I suppose the public
      likes the odors. It sniffs &rsquo;em up like&mdash;like Cyrano in the
      bake-shop. A marvelous institution, the public which you and I serve. Have
      you ever thought of magazine work, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be a considerable future there for you. I say &lsquo;might.&rsquo;
      Nothing is more uncertain. But you have certain&mdash;er&mdash;stigmata of
      the writer&mdash;That article, now, about the funereal eulogies over the
      old builder; did you report that talk as it was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approximately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How approximately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; the basic idea was there. The old fellows gave me that, and I
      fitted it up with talk. Surely there&rsquo;s nothing dishonest in that,&rdquo;
      protested Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; agreed the other. &ldquo;You gave the essence of
      the thing. That is a higher veracity than any literal reporting which
      would be dull and unreadable. I thought I recognized the fictional quality
      in the dialogue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t fiction,&rdquo; denied Banneker eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Gaines gave forth one of his oracles. &ldquo;But it was. Good
      dialogue is talk as it should be talked, just as good fiction is life as
      it should be lived&mdash;logically and consecutively. Why don&rsquo;t you
      try something for The New Era?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I got your note.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never reached me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never reached anybody. It&rsquo;s in my desk, ripening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send it along, green, won&rsquo;t you? It may give more indications
      that way. And first work is likely to be valuable chiefly as indication.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mail it to you. Before I go, would you mind telling me
      more definitely why you advise me against the newspaper business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise? I never advise as to questions of morals or ethics. I
      have too much concern with keeping my own straight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it <i>is</i> a question of morals?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or ethics. I think so. For example, have you tried your hand at
      editorials?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Successfully?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are in accord with the editorial policy of The Ledger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In its underlying, unexpressed, and immanent theory that this
      country can best be managed by an aristocracy, a chosen few, working under
      the guise of democracy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t believe that, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, as it happens. But I fail to see how Christian Banneker&rsquo;s
      son and <i>élève</i> could. Yet you write editorials for The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on those topics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never had your editorials altered or cut or amended, in
      such manner as to give a side-slant toward the paper&rsquo;s editorial
      fetiches?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and most uncomfortably Banneker felt his color change. &ldquo;Yes; I
      have,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do? The Chief controls the editorial page.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have stopped writing for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed the money. No; that isn&rsquo;t true. More than the money,
      I wanted the practice and the knowledge that I could write editorials if I
      wished to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking of going on the editorial side?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; cried Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unwilling to deal in other men&rsquo;s ideas, eh? Well, Mr.
      Banneker, you have plenty of troubles before you. Interesting ones,
      however.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much could I make by magazine writing?&rdquo; asked Banneker
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven alone knows. Less than you need, I should say, at first. How
      much do you need?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My space bill last week was one hundred and twenty-one dollars. I
      filled &rsquo;em up on Sunday specials.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you need that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gone,&rdquo; grinned Banneker boyishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As between a safe one hundred dollars-plus, and a highly
      speculative nothing-and-upwards, how could any prudent person waver?&rdquo;
      queried Mr. Gaines as he shook hands in farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in the whole unusual interview, Banneker found himself
      misliking the other&rsquo;s tone, particularly in the light emphasis
      placed upon the word prudent. Banneker did not conceive kindly of himself
      as a prudent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back at the office, Banneker got out the story of which he had spoken to
      Mr. Gaines, and read it over. It seemed to him good, and quite in the
      tradition of The New Era. It was polite, polished, discreet, and, if not
      precisely subtle, it dealt with interests and motives lying below the
      obvious surfaces of life. It had amused Banneker to write it; which is not
      to say that he spared laborious and conscientious effort. The New Era
      itself amused him, with its air of well-bred aloofness from the flatulent
      romanticism which filled the more popular magazines of the day with
      duke-like drummers or drummer-like dukes, amiable criminals and brisk
      young business geniuses, possessed of rather less moral sense than the
      criminals, for its heroes, and for its heroines a welter of adjectives
      exhaling an essence of sex. Banneker could imagine one of these females
      straying into Mr. Gaines&rsquo;s editorial ken, and that gentleman&rsquo;s
      bland greeting as to his own sprightly second maid arrayed and perfumed,
      unexpectedly encountered at a charity bazar. Too rarefied for Banneker&rsquo;s
      healthy and virile young tastes, the atmosphere in which The New Era lived
      and moved and had its consistently successful editorial being! He
      preferred a freer air to the mild scents of lavender and rose-ash, even
      though it might blow roughly at times. Nevertheless, that which was fine
      and fastidious in his mind recognized and admired the restraint, the
      dignity, the high and honorably maintained standards of the monthly. It
      had distinction. It stood apart from and consciously above the reading
      mob. In some respects it was the antithesis of that success for which Park
      Row strove and sweated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker felt that he, too, could claim a place on those heights. Yes; he
      liked his story. He thought that Mr. Gaines would like it. Having mailed
      it, he went to Katie&rsquo;s to dinner. There he found Russell Edmonds
      discussing his absurdly insufficient pipe with his customary air of
      careworn watchfulness lest it go out and leave him forlorn and unsolaced
      in a harsh world. The veteran turned upon the newcomer a grim twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it,&rdquo; he advised positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you I was considering it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. I knew it was about time for you to reach that point. We
      all do&mdash;at certain times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disenchantment. Disillusionment. Besides, I hear the city desk has
      been horsing you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then some one <i>has</i> been blabbing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those things ooze out. Can&rsquo;t keep &rsquo;em in. Besides,
      all city desks do that to cubs who come up too fast. It&rsquo;s part of
      the discipline. Like hazing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things a man can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Banneker
      with a sort of appeal in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Edmonds positively. &ldquo;Nothing he can&rsquo;t
      do to get the news.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever peep through a keyhole?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Figuratively speaking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like. Either way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you do it to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a phase a reporter has to go through?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t quit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. For a time. In a way. I went to jail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jail? You?&rdquo; Banneker had a flash of intuition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      bet it was for something you were proud of.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of the jail sentence, at any rate.
      Youngster, I&rsquo;m going to tell you about this.&rdquo; Edmonds&rsquo;s
      fine eyes seemed to have receded into their hollows as he sat thinking
      with his pipe neglected on the table. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know who Marna
      Corcoran was?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An actress, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leading lady at the old Coliseum Theater. A good actress and a good
      woman. I was a cub then on The Sphere under Red McGraw, the worst
      gutter-pup that ever sat at a city desk, and a damned good newspaper man.
      In those days The Sphere specialized on scandals; the rottener, the
      better; stuff that it wouldn&rsquo;t touch to-day. Well, a hell-cat of a
      society woman sued her husband for divorce and named Miss Corcoran. Pure
      viciousness, it was. There wasn&rsquo;t a shadow of proof, or even
      suspicion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember something about that case. The woman withdrew the
      charge, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it was too late. Red McGraw had an early tip and sent me to
      interview Marna Corcoran. He let me know pretty plainly that my job
      depended on my landing the story. That was his style; a bully. Well, I got
      the interview; never mind how. When I left her home Miss Corcoran was in a
      nervous collapse. I reported to McGraw. &lsquo;Keno!&rsquo; says he.
      &lsquo;Give us a column and a half of it. Spice it.&rsquo; I spiced it&mdash;I
      guess. They tell me it was a good job. I got lost in the excitement of
      writing and forgot what I was dealing with, a woman. We had a beat on that
      interview. They raised my salary, I remember. A week later Red called me
      to the desk. Got another story for you, Edmonds. A hummer. Marna Corcoran
      is in a private sanitarium up in Connecticut; hopelessly insane. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if our story did it.&rsquo; He grinned like an ape. &lsquo;Go up
      there and get it. Buy your way in, if necessary. You can always get to
      some of the attendants with a ten-spot. Find out what she raves about;
      whether it&rsquo;s about Allison. Perhaps she&rsquo;s given herself away.
      Give us another red-hot one on it. Here&rsquo;s the address.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wadded up the paper and stuffed it in his mouth. His lips felt
      pulpy. He hit me with a lead paper-weight and cut my head open. I don&rsquo;t
      know that I even hit him; I didn&rsquo;t specially want to hit him. I
      wanted to mark him. There was an extra-size open ink-well on his desk. I
      poured that over him and rubbed it into his face. Some of it got into his
      eyes. How he yelled! Of course he had me arrested. I didn&rsquo;t make any
      defense; I couldn&rsquo;t without bringing in Marna Corcoran&rsquo;s name.
      The Judge thought <i>I</i> was crazy. I was, pretty near. Three months, he
      gave me. When I came out Marna Corcoran was dead. I went to find Red
      McGraw and kill him. He was gone. I think he suspected what I would do. I&rsquo;ve
      never set eyes on him since. Two local newspapers sent for me as soon as
      my term was up and offered me jobs. I thought it was because of what I had
      done to McGraw. It wasn&rsquo;t. It was on the strength of the Marna
      Corcoran interview.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed a job, too. But I didn&rsquo;t take either of those. Later
      I got a better one with a decent newspaper. The managing editor said when
      he took me on: &lsquo;Mr. Edmonds, we don&rsquo;t approve of assaults on
      the city desk. But if you ever receive in this office an assignment of the
      kind that caused your outbreak, you may take it out on me.&rsquo; There
      are pretty fine people in the newspaper business, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds retrieved his pipe, discovering with a look of reproach and dismay
      that it was out. He wiped away some tiny drops of sweat which had come out
      upon the grayish skin beneath his eyes, while he was recounting his
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes my troubles seem petty,&rdquo; said Banneker, under his
      breath. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder why I told you all this,&rdquo; supplemented the
      veteran. &ldquo;Since I have, I&rsquo;ll tell you the rest; how I made
      atonement in a way. Ten years ago I was on a city desk myself. Not very
      long; but long enough to find I didn&rsquo;t like it. A story came to me
      through peculiar channels. It was a scandal story; one of those things
      that New York society whispers about all over the place, yet it&rsquo;s
      almost impossible to get anything to go on. When I tell you that even The
      Searchlight, which lives on scandal, kept off it, you can judge how
      dangerous it was. Well; I had it pat. It was really big stuff of its kind.
      The woman was brilliant, a daughter of one of the oldest and most noted
      New York families; and noted in her own right. She had never married:
      preferred to follow her career. The man was eminent in his line: not a
      society figure, except by marriage&mdash;his wife was active in the Four
      Hundred&mdash;because he had no tastes in that direction. He was nearly
      twenty years senior to the girl. The affair was desperate from the first.
      How far it went is doubtful; my informant gave it the worst complexion.
      Certainly there must have been compromising circumstances, for the wife
      left him, holding over him the threat of exposure. He cared nothing for
      himself; and the girl would have given up everything for him. But he was
      then engaged on a public work of importance; exposure meant the ruin of
      that. The wife made conditions; that the man should neither speak to, see,
      nor communicate with the girl. He refused. The girl went into exile and
      forced him to make the agreement. My informant had a copy of the letter of
      agreement; you can see how close she was to the family. She said that, if
      we printed it, the man would instantly break barriers, seek out the girl,
      and they would go away together. A front-page story, and exclusive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was a woman who held the key!&rdquo; exclaimed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds turned on him. &ldquo;What does that mean? Do you know anything of
      the story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all that you&rsquo;ve told me. I know the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you let me go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they&mdash;one of them&mdash;is my friend. There is no harm
      to her in my knowing. It might even be helpful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, I think you should have told me at once,&rdquo;
      grumbled the veteran. &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t take the story. The
      informer said that she would place it elsewhere. I told her that if she
      did I would publish the whole circumstances of her visit and offer, and
      make New York too hot to hold her. She retired, bulging with venom like a
      mad snake. But she dares not tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s wife, was it not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one representing her, I suspect. A bad woman, that wife. But I
      saved the girl in memory of Marna Corcoran. Think what the story would be
      worth, now that the man is coming forward politically!&rdquo; Edmonds
      smiled wanly. &ldquo;It was worth a lot even then, and I threw my paper
      down on it. Of course I resigned from the city desk at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fascinating game, being on the inside of the big
      things,&rdquo; ruminated Banneker. &ldquo;But when it comes to a man&rsquo;s
      enslaving himself to his paper, I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: you won&rsquo;t quit,&rdquo; prophesied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. That is, I&rsquo;ve resigned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. They all do, of your type. It was the peck of dirt, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordon won&rsquo;t let you go. And you won&rsquo;t have any more
      dirt thrown at you&mdash;probably. If you do, it&rsquo;ll be time enough
      then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there? What?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a pariah caste, Edmonds, we reporters. People look down
      on us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that be damned! You can&rsquo;t afford to be swayed by the
      ignorance or snobbery of outsiders. Play the game straight, and let the
      rest go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; persisted Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Pariahs?&rdquo; The look which the old-timer bent upon the
      rising star of the business had in it a quality of brooding and affection.
      &ldquo;Son, you&rsquo;re too young to have come properly to that frame of
      mind. That comes later. With the dregs of disillusion after the sparkle
      has died out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true. You admit it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If an outsider said that we were pariahs I&rsquo;d call him a liar.
      But, what&rsquo;s the use, with you? It isn&rsquo;t reporting alone. It&rsquo;s
      the whole business of news-getting and news-presenting; of journalism. We&rsquo;re
      under suspicion. They&rsquo;re afraid of us. And at the same time they&rsquo;re
      contemptuous of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because people are mostly fools and fools are afraid or
      contemptuous of what they don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker thought it over. &ldquo;No. That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he
      decided. &ldquo;Men that aren&rsquo;t fools and aren&rsquo;t afraid
      distrust us and despise the business. Edmonds, there&rsquo;s nothing
      wrong, essentially, in furnishing news for the public. It&rsquo;s part of
      the spread of truth. It&rsquo;s the handing on of the light. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      as big a thing as religion, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger. Religion, seven days a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, son,&rdquo; said Edmonds gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      thirsting for the clear and restoring doctrine of journalism. And I&rsquo;m
      going to give you hell&rsquo;s own heresy. You&rsquo;ll come to it anyway,
      in time.&rdquo; His fierce little pipe glowed upward upon his knotted
      brows. &ldquo;You talk about truth, news: news and truth as one and the
      same thing. So they are. But newspapers aren&rsquo;t after news: not
      primarily. Can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What are they after?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker turned the word over in his mind, evoking confirmation in the
      remembered headlines even of the reputable Ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sensation,&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the
      speed-up motto in industry. Our newspaper version of it is &lsquo;spice-up.&rsquo;
      A conference that may change the map of Europe will be crowded off any
      front page any day by young Mrs. Poultney Masters making a speech in favor
      of giving girls night-keys, or of some empty-headed society dame being
      caught in a roadhouse with another lady&rsquo;s hubby. Spice: that&rsquo;s
      what we&rsquo;re looking for. Something to tickle their jaded palates. And
      they despise us when we break our necks or our hearts to get it for
      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s what they want, the fault lies with the public,
      not with us,&rdquo; argued Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to know a white-stuff man&mdash;a cocaine-seller&mdash;who
      had the same argument down pat,&rdquo; retorted Edmonds quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker digested that for a time before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, you imply that because news is sensational, it must be
      unworthy. That isn&rsquo;t fair. Big news is always sensational. And of
      course the public wants sensation. After all, sensation of one sort or
      another is the proof of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence the noble profession of the pander,&rdquo; observed Edmonds
      through a coil of minute and ascending smoke-rings. &ldquo;He also serves
      the public.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drawing a parallel&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! It isn&rsquo;t the same thing, quite. But it&rsquo;s the
      same public. Let me tell you something to remember, youngster. The men who
      go to the top in journalism, the big men of power and success and grasp,
      come through with a contempt for the public which they serve, compared to
      which the contempt of the public for the newspaper is as skim milk to
      corrosive sublimate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s what is wrong with the business, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea,&rdquo; inquired Edmonds softly, &ldquo;what the
      philosophy of the Most Ancient Profession is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once heard a street-walker on the verge of D.T.&lsquo;s&mdash;she
      was intelligent; most of &rsquo;em are fools&mdash;express her analytical
      opinion of the men who patronized her. The men who make our news system
      have much the same notion of their public. How much poison <i>they</i>
      scatter abroad we won&rsquo;t know until a later diagnosis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you advise me to stick in the business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to. You are marked for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And help scatter the poison!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid! I&rsquo;ve been pointing out the disease of the
      business. There&rsquo;s a lot of health in it yet. But it&rsquo;s got to
      have new blood. I&rsquo;m too old to do more than help a little. Son, you&rsquo;ve
      got the stuff in you to do the trick. Some one is going to make a
      newspaper here in this rotten, stink-breathing, sensation-sniffing town
      that&rsquo;ll be based on news. Truth! There&rsquo;s your religion for
      you. Go to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And serve a public that I&rsquo;ll despise as soon as I get strong
      enough to disregard it&rsquo;s contempt for me,&rdquo; smiled Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find a public that you can&rsquo;t afford to despise,&rdquo;
      retorted the veteran. &ldquo;There is such a public. It&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; I&rsquo;ll know in a couple of weeks,&rdquo; said Banneker.
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> think I&rsquo;m about through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Edmonds&rsquo;s bitter wisdom had gone far toward confirming his
      resolution to follow up his first incursion into the magazine field if it
      met with the success which he confidently expected of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to hold him to his first allegiance, the ruling spirits of The
      Ledger now began to make things easy for him. Fat assignments came his way
      again. Events which seemed almost made to order for his pen were turned
      over to him by the city desk. Even though he found little time for Sunday
      &ldquo;specials,&rdquo; his space ran from fifteen to twenty-five dollars
      a day, and the &ldquo;Eban&rdquo; skits on the editorial page, now paid at
      double rates because of their popularity, added a pleasant surplus. To put
      a point to his mysteriously restored favor, Mr. Greenough called up one
      hot morning and asked Banneker to make what speed he could to Sippiac, New
      Jersey. Rioting had broken out between mill-guards and the strikers of the
      International Cloth Company factories, with a number of resulting
      fatalities. It was a &ldquo;big story.&rdquo; That Banneker was specially
      fitted, through his familiarity with the ground, to handle it, the city
      editor was not, of course, aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Sippiac, Banneker found the typical industrial tragedy of that time and
      condition, worked out to its logical conclusion. On the one side a small
      army of hired gun-men, assured of full protection and endorsement in
      whatever they might do: on the other a mob of assorted foreigners,
      ignorant, resentful of the law, which seemed only a huge mechanism of
      injustice manipulated by their oppressors, inflamed by the heavy potations
      of a festal night carried over into the next day, and, because of the
      criminally lax enforcement of the law, tacitly permitted to go armed. Who
      had started the clash was uncertain and, perhaps in essentials,
      immaterial; so perfectly and fatefully had the stage been set for mutual
      murder. At the close of the fray there were ten dead. One was a guard: the
      rest, strikers or their dependents, including a woman and a six-year-old
      child, both shot down while running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon Banneker was in the train returning
      to the city with a board across his knees, writing. Five hours later his
      account was finished. At the end of his work, he had one of those ideas
      for &ldquo;pointing&rdquo; a story, mere commonplaces of journalism
      nowadays, which later were to give him his editorial reputation. In the
      pride of his publicity-loving soul, Mr. Horace Vanney, chief owner of the
      International Cloth Mills, had given to Banneker a reprint of an address
      by himself, before some philosophical and inquiring society, wherein he
      had set forth some of his simpler economic theories. A quotation,
      admirably apropos to Banneker&rsquo;s present purposes, flashed forth
      clear and pregnant, to his journalistic memory. From the Ledger &ldquo;morgue&rdquo;
      he selected one of several cuts of Mr. Vanney, and turned it in to the
      night desk for publication, with this descriptive note:
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Vanney, Chairman of the Board of the International Cloth Company,
      Who declares that if working-women are paid more than a bare living wage,
      The surplus goes into finery and vanities which tempt them to ruin, Mr.
      Vanney&rsquo;s mills pay girls four dollars a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ravenously hungry, Banneker went out to order a long-delayed dinner at
      Katie&rsquo;s. Hardly had he swallowed his first mouthful of soup, when an
      office boy appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gordon wants to know if you can come back to the office at
      once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the theory that two minutes, while important to his stomach, would not
      greatly matter to the managing editor, Banneker consumed the rest of his
      soup and returned. He found Mr. Gordon visibly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker compiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t use that Sippiac story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sat silent and attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you write it that way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote it as I got it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a fair story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every fact&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a most unfair story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Sippiac, Mr. Gordon?&rdquo; inquired Banneker equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not. Nor can I believe it possible that you could acquire the
      knowledge of it implied in your article, in a few hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent some time investigating conditions there before I came on
      the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon was taken aback. Shifting his stylus to his left hand, he
      assailed severally the knuckles of his right therewith before he spoke.
      &ldquo;You know the principles of The Ledger, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get the facts and print them, so I have understood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are not facts.&rdquo; The managing editor rapped sharply upon
      the proof. &ldquo;This is editorial matter, hardly disguised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Descriptive, I should call it,&rdquo; returned the writer amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editorial. You have pictured Sippiac as a hell on earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentimentalism!&rdquo; snapped the other. His heavy visage wore a
      disturbed and peevish expression that rendered it quite plaintive. &ldquo;You
      have been with us long enough, Mr. Banneker, to know that we do not cater
      to the uplift-social trade, nor are we after the labor vote.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I understand that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you present here, what is, in effect, a damning indictment of
      the Sippiac Mills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts do that; not I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have selected your facts, cleverly&mdash;oh, very cleverly&mdash;to
      produce that effect, while ignoring facts on the other side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as the presence and influence of agitators. The evening
      editions have the names, and some of the speeches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is merely clouding the main issue. Conditions are such there
      that no outside agitation is necessary to make trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the agitators are there. They&rsquo;re an element and you have
      ignored it. Mr. Banneker, do you consider that you are dealing fairly with
      this paper, in attempting to commit it to an inflammatory, pro-strike
      course?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if the facts constitute that kind of an argument.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that picture of Horace Vanney? Is that news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It goes to the root of the whole trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To print that kind of stuff,&rdquo; said Mr. Gordon forcibly,
      &ldquo;would make The Ledger a betrayer of its own cause. What you
      personally believe is not the point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in facts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what The Ledger believes that is important here. You must
      appreciate that, as long as you remain on the staff, your only honorable
      course is to conform to the standards of the paper. When you write an
      article, it appears to our public, not as what Mr. Banneker says, but as
      what The Ledger says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Banneker thoughtfully, &ldquo;where the
      facts conflict with The Ledger&rsquo;s theories, I&rsquo;m expected to
      adjust the facts. Is that it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! You are expected to present the news fairly and
      without editorial emphasis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Gordon, but I don&rsquo;t believe I could
      rewrite that story so as to give a favorable slant to the International&rsquo;s
      side. Shooting down women and kids, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s voice was crisp as he cut in. &ldquo;There is no
      question of your rewriting it. That has been turned over to a man we can
      trust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To handle facts tactfully,&rdquo; put in Banneker in his mildest
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerably to his surprise, he saw a smile spread over Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s
      face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an obstinate young animal, Banneker,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Take this proof home, put it under your pillow and dream over
      it. Tell me a week from now what you think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker rose. &ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;m not fired?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m trusting in your essential honesty to bring you
      around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be quite frank,&rdquo; returned Banneker after a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve got to be convinced of The
      Ledger&rsquo;s essential honesty to come around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home and think it over,&rdquo; suggested the managing editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his associate, Andreas, he said, looking at Banneker&rsquo;s retreating
      back: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lose that young man, Andy. And we can&rsquo;t
      afford to lose him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Andreas, the fanatical
      devotee of the creed of news for news&rsquo; sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quixotism. Did you read his story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gordon looked up from his inflamed knuckles for an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great job,&rdquo; pronounced Andreas, almost reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no. Not for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a fair story,&rdquo; alleged the managing editor
      with a hint of the defensive in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too hot for that,&rdquo; the assistant supported his chief. &ldquo;And
      yet perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps what?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Gordon with roving and anxious
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Andreas.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as if he had finished, Mr. Gordon supplied the conclusion. &ldquo;Perhaps
      it is quite as fair as our recast article will be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, on the whole, fairer.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sound though Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s suggestion was, Banneker after the
      interview did not go home to think it over. He went to a telephone booth
      and called up the Avon Theater. Was the curtain down? It was, just. Could
      he speak to Miss Raleigh? The affair was managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bettina.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nearly dressed are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;half an hour or so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out for a bite, if I come up there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone receiver gave a transferred effect of conscientious
      consideration. &ldquo;No: I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;m tired. This is
      my night for sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a basis had the two young people come in the course of the police
      investigation and afterward, that an agreement had been formulated whereby
      Banneker was privileged to call up the youthful star at any reasonable
      hour and for any reasonable project, which she might accept or reject
      without the burden of excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; returned Banneker amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The receiver produced, in some occult manner, the manner of not being
      precisely pleased with this. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem much
      disappointed,&rdquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stricken but philosophical. Don&rsquo;t you see me,
      pierced to the heart, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; interrupted the instrument: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      flippant. Have you been drinking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Nor eating either, now that you remind me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has something happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is always happening in this restless world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has. And you want to tell me about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I just want to forget it, in your company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a decent night out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most respectable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may come and walk me home. I think the air will do me
      good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very light diet, though,&rdquo; observed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; responded the telephone in tones of patient
      resignation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch you eat. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at a quiet table in the restaurant, Betty Raleigh leaned back in
      her chair, turning expectant eyes upon her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell your aged maiden auntie all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say I was going to tell you about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you weren&rsquo;t. Therefore I wish to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m fired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fired? From The Ledger? Do you care?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the loss of the job? Not a hoot. Otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      going to fire myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh: that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see, it&rsquo;s a question of my doing my work my way or
      The Ledger&rsquo;s way. I prefer my way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And The Ledger prefers its way, I suppose. That&rsquo;s because
      what you call <i>your</i> work, The Ledger considers <i>its</i> work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, as a working entity, I belong to The Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a flattering thought. And if the paper wants me to
      falsify or suppress or distort, I have to do it. Is that the idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re big enough not to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being big enough means getting out, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or making yourself so indispensable that you can do things your own
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wise child, Betty,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What do
      you really think of the newspaper business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s frank, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve hurt your feelings. Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. Roused my curiosity: that&rsquo;s all. Why do you think
      it a rotten business?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so&mdash;so mean. It&rsquo;s petty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for example?&rdquo; he pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what Gurney did to me&mdash;to the play,&rdquo; she replied
      naïvely. &ldquo;Just to be smart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! Talk about the feminine propensity for proving a
      generalization by a specific instance! Gurney is an old man reared in an
      old tradition. He isn&rsquo;t metropolitan journalism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dramatic criticism,&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only one phase of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, a successful phase.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to produce his little sensation,&rdquo; ruminated
      Banneker, recalling Edmonds&rsquo;s bitter diagnosis. &ldquo;He does it by
      being clever. There are worse ways, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d always rather say a clever thing than a true one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker gave her a quick look. &ldquo;Is that the disease from which the
      newspaper business is suffering?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Anyway, it&rsquo;s no good for you, Ban, if it won&rsquo;t
      let you be yourself. And write as you think. This isn&rsquo;t new to me. I&rsquo;ve
      known newspaper men before, a lot of them, and all kinds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t any of them honest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots. But very few of them independent. They can&rsquo;t be. Not
      even the owners, though they think they are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d only have a hundred thousand bosses instead of one,&rdquo;
      said she wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about the public. They&rsquo;re your bosses,
      too, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m only a woman. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Besides, they&rsquo;re
      not. I lead em by the ear&mdash;the big, red, floppy ear. Poor dears!
      They think I love em all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas what you really love is the power within yourself to please
      them. You call it art, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! What a repulsive way to put it. You&rsquo;re revenging
      yourself for what I said about the newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I&rsquo;m drawing the deadly parallel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew down her pretty brows in thought. &ldquo;I see. But, at worst, I&rsquo;m
      interpreting in my own way. Not somebody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your author&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; she returned mutinously. &ldquo;I know how to
      put a line over better than he possibly could. That&rsquo;s <i>my</i>
      business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to write a play for you, Bettina.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; she challenged. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t try to teach
      me how to play it after it&rsquo;s written.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to see the effect of the bill-board&rsquo;s printing the
      star&rsquo;s name in letters two feet high and the playwright&rsquo;s in
      one-inch type.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspapers don&rsquo;t print yours at all, do they? Unless you
      shoot some one,&rdquo; she added maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d shine as a
      playwright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, then, if you fire yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiction, perhaps. It&rsquo;s slow but glorious, I understand. When
      I&rsquo;m starving in a garret, awaiting fame with the pious and cocksure
      confidence of genius, will you guarantee to invite me to a square meal
      once a fortnight? Think what it would give me to look forward to!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking him in the face with an expression of frank curiosity.
      &ldquo;Ban, does money never trouble you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;It comes somehow and
      goes every way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give the effect of spending it with graceful ease. Have you got
      much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little dribble of an income of my own. I make, I suppose, about a
      quarter of what your salary is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t readily imagine you ever being scrimped. You give
      the effect of pros&mdash;no, not of prosperity; of&mdash;well&mdash;absolute
      ease. It&rsquo;s quite different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much nicer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what they call you, around town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know I had attained the pinnacle of being called
      anything, around town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call you the best-dressed first-nighter in New York.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn!&rdquo; said Banneker fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fame, though. I know plenty of men who would give half
      of their remaining hairs for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need the hairs, but they can have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, too, you know, I&rsquo;m an asset.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An asset?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To you, I mean.&rdquo; She pursed her fingers upon the tip of
      her firm little chin and leaned forward. &ldquo;Our being seen so much
      together. Of course, that&rsquo;s a brashly shameless thing to say. But I
      never have to wear a mask for you. In that way you&rsquo;re a comfortable
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do have to furnish a diagram, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? You&rsquo;re not usually stupid. Whether you try for it or not&mdash;and
      I think there&rsquo;s a dash of the theatrical in your make-up&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      a picturesque sort of animal. And I&mdash;well, I help out the picture;
      make you the more conspicuous. It isn&rsquo;t your good looks alone&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      handsome as the devil, you know, Ban,&rdquo; she twinkled at him&mdash;&ldquo;nor
      the super-tailored effect which you pretend to despise, nor your fame as a
      gun-man, though that helps a lot.... I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of
      tea-talk: two flappers at The Plaza. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that
      wonderful-looking man over by the palm?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you know him? Why, that&rsquo;s Mr. Banneker.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      he; and what does he do? Have I seen him on the stage?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No,
      indeed! I don&rsquo;t know what he does; but he&rsquo;s an ex-ranchman and
      he held off a gang of river-pirates on a yacht, all alone, and killed
      eight or ten of them. Doesn&rsquo;t he look it!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go to afternoon teas,&rdquo; said the subject of this
      sprightly sketch, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will! If you don&rsquo;t look out. Now the same scene several
      years hence. Same flapper, answering same question: &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s
      Banneker? Oh, a reporter or something, on one of the papers.&rsquo; <i>Et
      voilà tout</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you were with me at the Plaza, as an asset, several years
      hence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;several years hence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker smiled radiantly. &ldquo;Which I am to take as fair warning that,
      unless I rise above my present lowly estate, that waxing young star, Miss
      Raleigh, will no longer&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! What right have you to think me a wretched little snob?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the world. It&rsquo;s I that am the snob, for even thinking
      about it. Just the same, what you said about &lsquo;only a reporter or
      something&rsquo; struck in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in a few years from now you won&rsquo;t be a reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I still be privileged to invite Miss Raleigh to supper&mdash;or
      was it tea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still angry. That isn&rsquo;t fair of you when I&rsquo;m
      being so frank. I&rsquo;m going to be even franker. I&rsquo;m feeling that
      way to-night. Comes of being tired, I suppose. Relaxing of the
      what-you-callems of inhibition. Do you know there&rsquo;s a lot of gossip
      about us, back of stage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there? Do you mind it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. They think I&rsquo;m crazy about you.&rdquo;
      Her clear, steady eyes did not change expression or direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not; are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not. That&rsquo;s the strange part of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for the flattering implication. But you couldn&rsquo;t take
      any serious interest in a mere reporter, could you?&rdquo; he said
      wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Betty laughed. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I! I could take serious
      interest in a tumblebug, at times. Other times I wouldn&rsquo;t care if
      the whole race of men were extinct&mdash;and that&rsquo;s most times. I
      feel your charm. And I like to be with you. You rest me. You&rsquo;re an
      asset, too, in a way, Ban; because you&rsquo;re never seen with any woman.
      You&rsquo;re supposed not to care for them.... You&rsquo;ve never tried to
      make love to me even the least little bit, Ban. I wonder why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds like an invitation, but&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know it isn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the delightful part of
      you; you do know things like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also I know better than to risk my peace of mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me, my dear,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo; Had he denied it, she
      would have said: &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;d deny it!&rdquo; the methods
      of feminine detective logic being so devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to talk about her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bad as that?&rdquo; she commiserated gently. &ldquo;Poor
      Ban! But you&rsquo;re young. You&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo; Her brooding
      eyes suddenly widened. &ldquo;Or perhaps you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
      amended with deeper perceptiveness. &ldquo;Have you been trying me as an
      anodyne?&rdquo; she demanded sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had the grace to blush. Instantly she rippled into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you at a loss before. You look as sheepish as
      a stage-door Johnnie when his inamorata gets into the other fellow&rsquo;s
      car. Ban, you never hung about stage-doors, did you? I think it would be
      good for you; tame your proud spirit and all that. Why don&rsquo;t you
      write one of your &lsquo;Eban&rsquo; sketches on John H. Stage-Door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better than that. Give me of your wisdom on the
      subject and I&rsquo;ll write an interview with you for Tittle-Tattle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! And make me awfully clever, please. Our press-agent hasn&rsquo;t
      put anything over for weeks. He&rsquo;s got a starving wife and seven
      drunken children, or something like that, and, as he&rsquo;ll take all the
      credit for the interview and even claim that he wrote it unless you sign
      it, perhaps it&rsquo;ll get him a raise and he can then buy the girl who
      plays the manicure part a bunch of orchids. <i>He</i>&rsquo;d have been a
      stage-door Johnnie if he hadn&rsquo;t stubbed his toe and become a
      press-agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;Now: I&rsquo;ll ask the
      stupid questions and you give the cutie answers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o&rsquo;clock when Miss Betty Raleigh, having seen the gist of
      all her witty and profound observations upon a strange species embodied in
      three or four scrawled notes on the back of a menu, rose and observed
      that, whereas acting was her favorite pastime, her real and serious
      business was sleep. At her door she held her face up to him as
      straightforwardly as a child. &ldquo;Good luck to you, dear boy,&rdquo;
      she said softly. &ldquo;If I ever were a fortune-teller, I would say that
      your star was for happiness and success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her cheek lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my try at
      success,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the other isn&rsquo;t so easy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find them one and the same,&rdquo; was her parting
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inured to work at all hours, Banneker went to the small, bare room in his
      apartment which he kept as a study, and sat down to write the interview.
      Angles of dawn-light had begun to irradiate the steep canyon of the street
      by the time he had finished. He read it over and found it good, for its
      purposes. Every line of it sparkled. It had the effervescent quality which
      the reading public loves to associate with stage life and stage people.
      Beyond that, nothing. Banneker mailed it to Miss Westlake for typing, had
      a bath, and went to bed. At noon he was at The Ledger office, fresh,
      alert, and dispassionately curious to ascertain the next resolution of the
      mix-up between the paper and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened; at least, nothing indicative. Mr. Greenough&rsquo;s
      expression was as flat and neutral as the desk over which he presided as
      he called Banneker&rsquo;s name and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Horace Vanney wishes to relieve his soul of some priceless
      information. Will you call at his office at two-thirty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Vanney&rsquo;s practice, whenever any of his enterprises
      appeared in a dubious or unfavorable aspect, immediately to materialize in
      print on some subject entirely unrelated, preferably an announcement on
      behalf of one of the charitable or civic organizations which he officially
      headed. Thus he shone forth as a useful, serviceable, and public-spirited
      citizen, against whom (such was the inference which the newspaper reader
      was expected to draw) only malignancy could allege anything injurious. In
      this instance his offering upon the altar of publicity, carefully typed
      and mimeographed, had just enough importance to entitle it to a paragraph
      of courtesy. After it was given out to those who called, Mr. Vanney
      detained Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read the morning papers, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s my business, Mr. Vanney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can see, by the outbreak in Sippiac, to what disastrous
      results anarchism and fomented discontent lead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on the point of view. I believe that, after my visit to the
      mills for you, I told you that unless conditions were bettered you&rsquo;d
      have another and worse strike. You&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately it is under control. The trouble-makers and thugs have
      been taught a needed lesson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially the six-year-old trouble-making thug who was shot
      through the lungs from behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vanney scowled. &ldquo;Unfortunate. And the papers laid unnecessary
      stress upon that. Wholly unnecessary. Most unfair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would hardly accuse The Ledger, at least, of being unfair to
      the mill interests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The Ledger&rsquo;s handling, while less objectionable than
      some of the others, was decidedly unfortunate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker gazed at him in stupefaction. &ldquo;Mr. Vanney, The Ledger
      minimized every detail unfavorable to the mills and magnified every one
      which told against the strikers. It was only its skill that concealed the
      bias in every paragraph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not over-loyal to your employer, sir,&rdquo; commented the
      other severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;m defending the paper against your aspersions,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most unfair,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Vanney. &ldquo;Why publish such
      matter at all? It merely stirs up more discontent and excites hostility
      against the whole industrial system which has made this country great. And
      I give more copy to the newspaper men than any other public man in New
      York. It&rsquo;s rank ingratitude, that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo; He
      meditated upon the injurious matter. &ldquo;I suppose we ought to have
      advertised,&rdquo; he added pensively. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;d let us
      alone as they do the big stores.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker left the Vanney offices with a great truth illuminating his
      brain; to wit, that news, whether presented ingenuously or disingenuously,
      will always and inevitably be unpopular with those most nearly affected.
      For while we all read avidly what we can find about the other man&rsquo;s
      sins and errors, we all hope, for our own, the kindly mantle of silence.
      And because news always must and will stir hostility, the attitude of a
      public, any part of which may be its next innocent (or guilty) victim, is
      instinctively inimical. Another angle of the pariahdom of those who deal
      in day-to-day history, for Banneker to ponder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling a strong desire to get away from the troublous environment of
      print, Banneker was glad to avail himself of Densmore&rsquo;s invitation
      to come to The Retreat on the following Monday and try his hand at polo
      again. This time he played much better, his mallet work in particular
      being more reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ride like an Indian,&rdquo; said Densmore to him after the
      scratch game, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve got no nerves. But I don&rsquo;t see
      where you got your wrist, except by practice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the practice, some time since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve only knocked about the field with stable-boys&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only play I&rsquo;ve ever had. But when I was
      riding range in the desert, I picked up an old stick and a ball of the
      owner&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ve chased that ball over more miles of sand and
      rubble than you&rsquo;d care to walk. Cactus plants make very fair goal
      posts, too; but the sand is tricky going for the ball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Densmore whistled. &ldquo;That explains it. Maitland says you&rsquo;ll
      make the club team in two years. Let us get together and fix you up some
      ponies,&rdquo; invited Densmore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shook his head, but wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you&rsquo;re making enough to carry your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be ten years, in the newspaper business. Or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get out of it. Let Old Man Masters find you something in the
      Street. You could get away with it,&rdquo; persuaded Densmore. &ldquo;And
      he&rsquo;ll do anything for a polo-man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. No paid-athlete job for mine. I&rsquo;d rather stay
      a reporter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the club, anyway. You can afford that. And at least you
      can take a mount on your day off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of another job where I&rsquo;ll have more time
      to myself than one day a week,&rdquo; confessed Banneker, having in mind
      possible magazine work. He thought of the pleasant remoteness of The
      Retreat. It was expensive; it would involve frequent taxi charges. But, as
      ever, Banneker had an unreasoning faith in a financial providence of
      supply. &ldquo;Yes: I&rsquo;ll come in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is, if
      I can get in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get in, with Poultney Masters for a backer. Otherwise,
      I&rsquo;ll tell you frankly, I think your business would keep you out, in
      spite of your polo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Densmore, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to put up
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Densmore&rsquo;s heavy brows came to attention. &ldquo;Fire ahead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were ready to beat me up when I came here to ask you certain
      questions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was. Any fellow would be. You would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But suppose, through the work of some other reporter, a
      divorce story involving the sister and brother-in-law of some chap in your
      set had appeared in the papers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No concern of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d read it, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if your paper didn&rsquo;t have it in and another paper did,
      you&rsquo;d buy the other paper to find out about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was interested in the people, I might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what kind of a sport are you, when you&rsquo;re keen to read
      about other people&rsquo;s scandals, but sore on any one who inquires
      about yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the other fellow&rsquo;s bad luck. If he&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get my point. A newspaper is simply a news
      exchange. If you&rsquo;re ready to read about the affairs of others, you
      should not resent the activity of the newspaper that attempts to present
      yours. I&rsquo;m merely advancing a theory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damned ingenious,&rdquo; admitted the polo-player. &ldquo;Make a
      reporter a sort of public agent, eh? Only, you see, he isn&rsquo;t. He
      hasn&rsquo;t any right to my private affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of his efforts, as you do
      when you read about your friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too fine-spun for me. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you;
      just because I take a drink at a bar I don&rsquo;t make a pal of the
      bartender. It comes to about the same thing, I fancy. You&rsquo;re trying
      to justify your profession. Let me ask <i>you</i>; do you feel that you&rsquo;re
      within your decent rights when you come to a stranger with such a question
      as you put up to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Banneker ruefully. &ldquo;I feel
      like a man trying to hold up a bigger man with a toy pistol.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better get into some other line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever hopes Banneker may have had of the magazine line suffered a
      set-back when, a few days later, he called upon the Great Gaines at his
      office, and was greeted with a cheery though quizzical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve read it,&rdquo; said the editor at once, not
      waiting for the question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clever. It&rsquo;s amazingly
      clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it,&rdquo; replied Banneker, pleased but
      not surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gaines&rsquo;s expression became one of limpid innocence. &ldquo;Like
      it? Did I say I liked it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you didn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As a matter of fact I don&rsquo;t like it. Dear me, no! Not at
      all. Where did you get the idea?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gaines abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no. Not the plot. The plot is nothing. The idea of choosing
      such an environment and doing the story in that way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From The New Era Magazine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to see. You have been studying the magazine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Since I first had the idea of trying to write for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flattered, indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Gaines dryly. &ldquo;And you
      modeled yourself upon&mdash;what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote the type of story which the magazine runs to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. You did not. You wrote, if you will forgive me, an
      imitation of that type. Your story has everything that we strive for
      except reality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe that I have deliberately copied&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A type, not a story. No; you are not a plagiarist, Mr. Banneker.
      But you are very thoroughly a journalist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming from you that can hardly be accounted a compliment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor is it so intended. But I don&rsquo;t wish you to misconstrue
      me. You are not a journalist in your style and method; it goes deeper than
      that. You are a journalist in your&mdash;well, in your approach. &lsquo;What
      the public wants.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly Banneker was raging. The incisive perception stung. But he spoke
      lightly. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t The New Era want what its public wants?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, in the words of a man who ought to have been an editor
      of to-day, &lsquo;The public be damned!&rsquo; What I looked to you for
      was not your idea of what somebody else wanted you to write, but your
      expression of what you yourself want to write. About hoboes. About
      railroad wrecks. About cowmen or peddlers or waterside toughs or
      stage-door Johnnies, or ward politicians, or school-teachers, or life. Not
      pink teas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read pink-tea stories in your magazine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have. Written by people who could see through the
      pink to the primary colors underneath. When <i>you</i> go to a pink tea,
      you are pink. Did you ever go to one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still thoroughly angry, Banneker nevertheless laughed, &ldquo;Then the
      story is no use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to us, certainly. Miss Thornborough almost wept over it. She
      said that you would undoubtedly sell it to The Bon Vivant and be damned
      forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank her on my behalf,&rdquo; returned the other gravely. &ldquo;If
      The Bon Vivant wants it and will pay for it, I shall certainly sell it to
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of pique?... Hold hard, young sir! You can&rsquo;t shoot an
      editor in his sanctum because of an ill-advised but natural question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. Nor do I want&mdash;well, yes; I would rather like to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s natural and genuine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think The Bon Vivant would pay for that story?&rdquo;
      inquired Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a hundred dollars. Cheap, for a career, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the assumption that there is but one pathway to the
      True Art and but one signboard pointing to it a little excessive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abominably. There are a thousand pathways, broad and narrow. They
      all go uphill.... Some day when you spin something out of your own inside,
      Mr. Banneker, forgive the well-meaning editor and let us see it. It might
      be pure silk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way downtown, Banneker cursed inwardly but brilliantly. This was
      his first set-back. Everything prior which he had attempted had been
      successful. Inevitably the hard, firm texture of his inner endurance had
      softened under the spoiled-child treatment which the world had readily
      accorded him. Even while he recognized this, he sulked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some extent he was cheered up by a letter from the editor of that
      lively and not too finicky publication, Tittle-Tattle. The interview with
      Miss Raleigh was acclaimed with almost rapturous delight. It was precisely
      the sort of thing wanted. Proof had already been sent to Miss Raleigh, who
      was equally pleased. Would Mr. Banneker kindly read and revise enclosed
      proof and return it as soon as possible? Mr. Banneker did better than
      that. He took back the corrected proof in person. The editor was most
      cordial, until Banneker inquired what price was to be paid for the
      interview. Then the editor was surprised and grieved. It appeared that he
      had not expected to pay anything for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect to get copy for nothing?&rdquo; inquired the
      astonished and annoyed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes to that,&rdquo; retorted the sharp-featured young man
      at the editorial desk, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s getting
      something for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off! This is red-hot advertising matter for Betty Raleigh, and
      you know it. Why, I ought to charge a coupla hundred for running it at
      all. But you being a newspaper man and the stuff being so snappy, I&rsquo;m
      willing to make an exception. Besides, you&rsquo;re a friend of Raleigh&rsquo;s,
      ain&rsquo;t you? Well&mdash;&lsquo;nuff said!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the tip of Banneker&rsquo;s tongue to demand the copy back.
      Then he bethought himself of Betty&rsquo;s disappointment. The thing <i>was</i>
      well done. If he had been a thousand miles short of giving even a hint of
      the real Betty&mdash;who was a good deal of a person&mdash;at least he had
      embodied much of the light and frivolous charm which was her stage
      stock-in-trade, and what her public wanted. He owed her that much, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left, and on the street-car immersed himself in some disillusioning
      calculations. Suppose he did sell the rejected story to The Bon Vivant.
      One hundred dollars, he had learned, was the standard price paid by that
      frugal magazine; that would not recompense him for the time bestowed upon
      it. He could have made more by writing &ldquo;specials&rdquo; for the
      Sunday paper. And on top of that to find that a really brilliant piece of
      interviewing had brought him in nothing more substantial than
      congratulations and the sense of a good turn done for a friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      The magazine field, he began to suspect, might prove to be arid land.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      What next? Banneker put the query to himself with more seriousness than he
      had hitherto given to estimating the future. Money, as he told Betty
      Raleigh, had never concerned him much. His start at fifteen dollars a week
      had been more than he expected; and though his one weekly evening of mild
      sybaritism ate up all his margin, and his successful sartorial experiments
      consumed his private surplus, he had no cause for worry, since his salary
      had been shortly increased to twenty, and even more shortly thereafter to
      twenty-five. Now it was a poor week in which he did not exceed the
      hundred. All of it went, rather more fluently than had the original
      fifteen. Frugal though he could be in normal expenditures, the rental of
      his little but fashionably situated apartment, his new club expenses, his
      polo outfit, and his occasional associations with the after-theater
      clique, which centered at The Avon, caused the debit column to mount with
      astonishing facility. Furthermore, through his Western associations he had
      an opportunity to pick up two half-broken polo ponies at bargain prices.
      He had practically decided to buy them. Their keep would be a serious
      item. He must have more money. How to get it? Harder work was the obvious
      answer. Labor had no terrors for Banneker. Mentally he was a hardened
      athlete, always in training. Being wise and self-protective, he did no
      writing on his day off. But except for this period of complete relaxation,
      he gave himself no respite. Any morning which did not find him writing in
      his den, after a light, working breakfast, he put in at the Library near
      by, insatiably reading economics, sociology, politics, science, the more
      serious magazines, and always the news and comments of the day. He was
      possessed of an assertive and sane curiosity to know what was going on in
      the world, an exigence which pressed upon him like a healthy appetite, the
      stimulus of his hard-trained mental condition. The satisfaction of this
      demand did not pay an immediate return; he obtained little or no actual
      material to be transmuted into the coin of so-much-per-column, except as
      he came upon suggestions for editorial use; and, since his earlier
      experience of The Ledger&rsquo;s editorial method with contributions
      (which he considered light-fingered), he had forsworn this medium.
      Notwithstanding this, he wrote or sketched out many an editorial which
      would have astonished, and some which would have benefited, the Inside
      Room where the presiding genius, malicious and scholarly, dipped his pen
      alternately into luminous ether and undiluted venom. Some day, Banneker
      was sure, he himself was going to say things editorially.
    </p>
    <p>
      His opinion of the editorial output in general was unflattering. It seemed
      to him bound by formalism and incredibly blind to the immense and vivid
      interest of the news whereby it was surrounded, as if a man, set down in a
      meadow full of deep and clear springs, should elect to drink from a
      shallow, torpid, and muddy trickle. Legislation, taxes, transportation
      problems, the Greatness of Our City, our National Duty (whatever it might
      be at the time&mdash;and according to opinion), the drink question, the
      race problem, labor and capital; these were the reiterated topics, dealt
      with informatively often, sometimes wittily, seldom impartially. But, at
      best, this was but the creaking mechanism of the artificial structure of
      society, and it was varied only by an occasional literary or artistic
      sally, or a preachment in the terms of a convinced moralization upon the
      unvarying text that the wages of sin is death. Why not a touch of
      humanism, now and again, thought Banneker, following the inevitable
      parallels in paper after paper; a ray of light striking through into the
      life-texture beneath?
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of experiment he watched the tide of readers, flowing through the
      newspaper room of the Public Library, to ascertain what they read. Not one
      in thirty paid any attention to the editorial pages. Essaying farther
      afield, he attended church on several occasions. His suspicions were
      confirmed; from the pulpit he heard, addressed to scanty congregations,
      the same carefully phrased, strictly correct comments, now dealing,
      however, with the mechanism of another world. The chief point of
      difference was that the newspaper editorials were, on the whole, more
      felicitously worded and more compactly thought out. Essentially, however,
      the two ran parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker wondered whether the editorial rostrum, too, was fated to deliver
      its would-be authoritative message to an audience which threatened to
      dwindle to the vanishing point. Who read those carefully wrought columns
      in The Ledger? Pot-bellied chair-warmers in clubs; hastening business men
      appreciative of the daily assurance that stability is the primal and final
      blessing, discontent the cardinal sin, the extant system perfect and holy,
      and any change a wile of the forces of destruction&mdash;as if the human
      race had evoluted by the power of standing still! For the man in the
      street they held no message. No; nor for the woman in the home. Banneker
      thought of young Smith of the yacht and the coming millions, with a
      newspaper waiting to drop into his hands. He wished he could have that
      newspaper&mdash;any newspaper, for a year. He&rsquo;d make the man in the
      street sit up and read his editorials. Yes, and the woman in the home. Why
      not the boy and the girl in school, also? Any writer, really master of his
      pen, ought to be able to make even a problem in algebra editorially
      interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he could make it interesting, he could make it pay.... But how was
      he to profit by all this hard work, this conscientious technical training
      to which he was devoting himself? True, it was improving his style. But
      for the purposes of Ledger reporting, he wrote quite well enough.
      Betterment here might be artistically satisfactory; financially it would
      be fruitless. Already his space bills were the largest, consistently, on
      the staff, due chiefly to his indefatigable industry in devoting every
      spare office hour to writing his &ldquo;Eban&rdquo; sketches, now paid at
      sixteen dollars a column, and Sunday &ldquo;specials.&rdquo; He might push
      this up a little, but not much.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the magazine field, expectations were meager in the immediate sense.
      True, The Bon Vivant had accepted the story which The Era rejected; but it
      had paid only seventy-five dollars. Banneker did not care to go farther on
      that path. Aside from the unsatisfactory return, his fastidiousness
      revolted from being identified with the output of a third-class and flashy
      publication. Whatever The Ledger&rsquo;s shortcomings, it at least stood
      first in its field. But was there any future for him there, other than as
      a conspicuously well-paid reporter? In spite of the critical situation
      which his story of the Sippiac riots had brought about, he knew that he
      was safe as long as he wished to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too valuable to lose,&rdquo; said Tommy Burt, swinging
      his pudgy legs over Banneker&rsquo;s desk, having finished one of his
      mirthful stories of a row between a wine agent and a theatrical manager
      over a doubly reserved table in a conspicuous restaurant. &ldquo;Otherwise&mdash;phutt!
      But they&rsquo;ll be very careful what kind of assignments they hand over
      to your reckless hands in future. You mustn&rsquo;t throw expensive and
      brittle conventions at the editor&rsquo;s head. They smash.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fragments come back and cut. I know. But what does it all
      lead to, Tommy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on which way you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the top, naturally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From anybody else that would sound blatant, Ban,&rdquo; returned
      Tommy admiringly. &ldquo;Somehow you get away with it. Are you as sincere
      as you act?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In so far as my intentions go. Of course, I may trip up and break
      myself in two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll always fall light. There&rsquo;s a buoyancy about
      you.... But what about coming to the end of the path and finding nowhere
      else to proceed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paragon of wisdom, you have stated the situation. Now produce the
      answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money?&rdquo; inquired Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More money. More opportunity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got to aim at the executive end. Begin by taking
      a copy-desk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At forty a week?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so long ago that twenty-five looked pretty big to
      you, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of centuries ago,&rdquo; stated Banneker positively.
      &ldquo;Forty a week wouldn&rsquo;t keep me alive now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could write a lot of specials. Or do outside work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But what would a desk lead to?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;City editor. Night city editor. Night editor. Managing editor at
      fifteen thou.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After ten years. If one has the patience. I haven&rsquo;t. Besides,
      what chance would <i>I</i> have?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, with the present lot in the Inside Room. You&rsquo;re a
      heretic. You&rsquo;re unsound. You&rsquo;ve got dangerous ideas&mdash;accent
      on the dangerous. I doubt if they&rsquo;d even trust you with a blue
      pencil. You might inject something radical into a thirty-head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Banneker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still new at this
      game. What becomes of star reporters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; replied Tommy brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; retorted Banneker. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s guff. There
      aren&rsquo;t three heavy drinkers in this office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of the best men go that way,&rdquo; persisted Burt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      the late hours and the irregular life, I suppose. Some drift out into
      other lines. This office has trained a lot of playwrights and authors and
      ad-men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some must stick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They play out early. The game is too hard. They get to be hacks. <i>Or</i>
      permanent desk-men. D&rsquo;you know Philander Akely?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me who he <i>was</i> and I&rsquo;ll tell you. He was the
      brilliant youngster, the coruscating firework, the&mdash;the Banneker of
      ten years ago. Come into the den and meet him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the inner rooms Banneker was introduced to a fragile,
      desiccated-looking man languidly engaged in scissoring newspaper after
      newspaper which he took from a pile and cast upon the floor after
      operation. The clippings he filed in envelopes. A checkerboard lay on the
      table beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you play draughts, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; he asked in a rumbling
      bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little and very poorly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sighed. &ldquo;It is pure logic, in the form of contest. Far
      more so than chess, which is merely sustained effort of concentration. Are
      you interested in emblemology?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I know almost nothing of it,&rdquo; confessed
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Akely sighed again, gave Banneker a glance which proclaimed an utter lack
      of interest, and plunged his shears into the editorial vitals of the
      Springfield Republican. Tommy Burt led the surprised Banneker away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dried up, played out, and given a measly thirty-five a week as
      hopper-feeder for the editorial room,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;And he
      was the star man of his time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty rotten treatment for him, then,&rdquo; said
      Banneker indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. He isn&rsquo;t worth what he gets. Most offices
      would have chucked him out on the street.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular. Just wore his machine out. Everything going
      out, nothing coming in. He spun out enough high-class copy to keep the
      ordinary reporter going for a life-time; but he spun it out too fast.
      Nothing left. The tragedy of it is that he&rsquo;s quite happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t a tragedy at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on whether you take the Christian or the Buddhist point of
      view. He&rsquo;s found his Nirvana in checker problems and collecting
      literature about insignia. Write? I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;d want to
      if he could. &lsquo;There but for the grace of God goes&rsquo;&mdash;you
      or I. <i>I</i> think the <i>facilis descensus</i> to the gutter is almost
      preferable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve shown him to me as a dreadful warning, have you,
      Tommy?&rdquo; mused Banneker aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of it, Ban; get out of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get out of it yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inertia. Or cowardice. And then, I haven&rsquo;t come to the
      turning-point yet. When I do reach it, perhaps it&rsquo;ll be too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon the turning-point?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you feel the excitement of the game,&rdquo; explained
      this veteran of thirty, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all right. That will keep you
      going; the sense of adventure, of change, of being in the thick of things.
      But there&rsquo;s an underlying monotony, so they tell me: the monotony of
      seeing things by glimpses, of never really completing a job, of being
      inside important things, but never of them. That gets into your veins like
      a clogging poison. Then you&rsquo;re through. Quit it, Ban, before it&rsquo;s
      too late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not going to quit the game. It&rsquo;s my game. I&rsquo;m
      going to beat it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. You&rsquo;ve got the brains. But I think you&rsquo;re too
      stiff in the backbone. Go-to-hell-if-you-don&rsquo;t-like-the-way-I-do-it
      may be all right for a hundred-dollar-a-week job; but it doesn&rsquo;t get
      you a managing editorship at fifteen to twenty thousand. Even if it did,
      you&rsquo;d give up the go-to-hell attitude as soon as you landed, for
      fear it would cost you your job and be too dear a luxury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Walpole,&rdquo; laughed Banneker. &ldquo;When I find
      what my price is, I&rsquo;ll let you know. Meantime I&rsquo;ll think over
      your well-meant advice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the normal way of advancement were closed to him in The Ledger office
      because of his unsound and rebellious attitude on social and labor
      questions, there might be better opportunities in other offices, Banneker
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before taking any step he decided to talk over the general situation with
      that experienced campaigner, Russell Edmonds. Him and his diminutive pipe
      he found at Katie&rsquo;s, after most of the diners had left. The veteran
      nodded when Banneker told him of his having reached what appeared to be a
      <i>cul-de-sac</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time you quit,&rdquo; said Edmonds vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed your mind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder nodded between two spirals of smoke which gave him the
      appearance of an important godling delivering oracles through incense.
      &ldquo;That was a dam&rsquo; bad story you wrote of the Sippiac killings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t uh? You were there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story went to the office cat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the stuff they printed? Amalgamated Wire Association?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Machine-made rewrite in the office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t dishonest. The Ledger&rsquo;s too clever for that.
      It was unhonest. You can&rsquo;t be both neutral and fair on cold-blooded
      murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t precisely neutral in The Courier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds chuckled. &ldquo;I did rather put it over on the paper. But that
      was easy. Simply a matter of lining up the facts in logical sequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace Vanney says you&rsquo;re an anarchist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutual. I think he&rsquo;s one. To hell with all laws
      and rights that discommode <i>Me</i> and <i>My</i> interests. That&rsquo;s
      the Vanney platform.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks he ought to have advertised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wise guy! So he ought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To secure immunity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It required six long, hard puffs to elicit from Edmonds the opinion:
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have got it. Partly. Not all he paid for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from The Ledger,&rdquo; said Banneker jealously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      independent in that respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bribe your own heeler. The
      Ledger believes in Vanney&rsquo;s kind of anarchism, as in a religion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could he have bought off The Courier?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing as raw as that. But it&rsquo;s quite possible that if the
      Sippiac Mills had been a heavy advertiser, the paper wouldn&rsquo;t have
      sent me to the riots. Some one more sympathetic, maybe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they kick on your story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? The mill people? Howled!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t get them anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it! You know how difficult it is to get anything for
      publication out of old Rockface Enderby. Well, I had a brilliant idea that
      this was something he&rsquo;d talk about. Law Enforcement stuff, you know.
      And he did. Gave me a hummer of an interview. Tore the guts out of the
      mill-owners for violating all sorts of laws, and put it up that the
      mill-guards were themselves a lawless organization. There&rsquo;s nothing
      timid about Enderby. Why, we&rsquo;d have started a controversy that would
      be going yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interview was killed,&rdquo; replied Edmonds, grinning ruefully.
      &ldquo;For the best interests of the paper. That&rsquo;s what the Vanney
      crowd&rsquo;s kick got them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop, what do you make of Willis Enderby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s plodding along only a couple of decades behind his
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reactionary?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say he was plodding along? A reactionary is
      immovable except in the wrong direction. Enderby&rsquo;s a conservative.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a socialist you&rsquo;re against any one who isn&rsquo;t as
      radical as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not against Willis Enderby. I&rsquo;m for him,&rdquo;
      grunted the veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why; if he&rsquo;s a conservative?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for that, I can bring a long indictment against him. He&rsquo;s
      a firm believer in the capitalistic system. He&rsquo;s enslaved to the old
      economic theories, supply and demand, and all that rubbish from the ruins
      of ancient Rome. He believes that gold is the only sound material for
      pillars of society. The aristocratic idea is in his bones.&rdquo; Edmonds,
      by a feat of virtuosity, sent a thin, straight column of smoke, as it
      might have been an allegorical and sardonic pillar itself, almost to the
      ceiling. &ldquo;But he believes in fair play. Free speech. Open field. The
      rigor of the game. He&rsquo;s a sportsman in life and affairs. That&rsquo;s
      why he&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous? To whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the established order. To the present system. Why, son, all we
      Socialists ask is fair play. Give us an even chance for labor, for the
      proletariat; an even show before the courts, an open forum in the
      newspapers, the right to organize as capital organizes, and we&rsquo;ll
      win. If we can&rsquo;t win, we deserve to lose. I say that men like Willis
      Enderby are our strongest supporters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he thinks his side will win, under the strict rules of the
      game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But if he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d still be for fair
      play, to the last inch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty fine thing to say of a man, Pop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty fine man,&rdquo; said Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Enderby want? What is he after?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For himself? Nothing. It&rsquo;s something to be known as the
      ablest honest lawyer in New York. Or, you can turn it around and say he&rsquo;s
      the honestest able lawyer in New York. I think, myself, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      be far astray if you said the ablest and honestest. No; he doesn&rsquo;t
      want anything more than what he&rsquo;s got: his position, his money, his
      reputation. Why should he? But it&rsquo;s going to be forced on him one of
      these days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politically?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Whatever there is of leadership in the reform element here
      centers in him. It&rsquo;s only a question of time when he&rsquo;ll have
      to carry the standard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be able to fall in behind him when the time
      comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On The Ledger?&rdquo; grunted Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shan&rsquo;t be on The Ledger when the time comes. Not if I
      can find any other place to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty of places,&rdquo; affirmed Edmonds positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but will they give me the chance I want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you make it for yourself. But let&rsquo;s canvass
      &rsquo;em. You want a morning paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Not enough salary in the evening field.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well: you&rsquo;ve thought of The Sphere first, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. I like their editorial policy. Their news policy makes
      me seasick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so strong for the editorials. They&rsquo;re always
      for reform and never for progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but that&rsquo;s epigram.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, nevertheless. The Sphere is always tiptoeing up to
      the edge of some decisive policy, and then running back in alarm. What of
      The Observer? They&rsquo;re looking for new blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Observer! O Lord! Preaches the eternal banalities and believes
      them the eternal verities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Epigram, yourself,&rdquo; grinned Edmonds. &ldquo;Well, The
      Monitor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three-card Monitor, and marked cards at that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;d have to watch the play. The Graphic then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but an ornamental ghost. The ghost of a once handsomely
      kept lady. I don&rsquo;t aspire to write daily epitaphs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And The Messenger I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t even call a kept
      lady. Too common. Babylonian stuff. But The Express is respectable enough
      for anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And conscious of it in every issue. One long and pious scold, after
      a high-minded, bad-tempered formula of its own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give you a motto for your Ledger.&rdquo; Edmonds
      puffed it out enjoyably,&mdash;decorated with bluish and delicate whorls.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Meliora video proboque, deleriora sequor</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I won&rsquo;t have that. The last part will do; we do follow
      the worser way; but if we see the better, we don&rsquo;t approve it. We
      don&rsquo;t even recognize it as the better. We&rsquo;re honestly
      convinced in our advocacy of the devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;re honestly convinced of anything
      on The Courier, except of the desirability of keeping friendly with
      everybody. But such as we are, we&rsquo;d grab at you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; thanks, Pop. You yourself are enough in the troubled-water
      duckling line for one old hen like The Courier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there remains only The Patriot, friend of the Pee-pul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skimmed scum,&rdquo; was Banneker&rsquo;s prompt definition.
      &ldquo;And nothing in the soup underneath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ernst, the waiter, scuttled across the floor below, and disappeared back
      of the L-angle a few feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s dining there,&rdquo; remarked Edmonds, &ldquo;while
      we&rsquo;ve been stripping the character off every paper in the field.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it be all the editors and owners in a lump!&rdquo; said
      Banneker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t talk louder. I&rsquo;m
      feeling reckless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad frame of mind for a man seeking a job. By the way, what <i>are</i>
      you out after, exactly? Aiming at the editorial page, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker leaned over the table, his face earnest to the point of
      somberness. &ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know I can write.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can write like the devil,&rdquo; Edmonds offered up on twin
      supports of vapor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I can do more than that. I can think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For self, or others?&rdquo; propounded the veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take you. I can think for myself and make it profitable to
      others, if I can find the chance. Why, Pop, this editorial game is child&rsquo;s
      play!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Experimentally. The opportunities are limitless. I could make
      people read editorials as eagerly as they read scandal or baseball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By making them as simple and interesting as scandal or baseball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! As easy as that,&rdquo; observed Edmonds scornfully. &ldquo;High
      art, son! Nobody&rsquo;s found the way yet. Perhaps, if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, took his pipe from his lips and let his raised eyes level
      themselves toward the corner of the L where appeared a figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you gentlemen mind if I took my coffee with you?&rdquo; said
      the newcomer smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker looked with questioning eyebrows toward Edmonds, who nodded.
      &ldquo;Come up and sit down, Mr. Marrineal,&rdquo; invited Banneker,
      moving his chair to leave a vacancy between himself and his companion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tertius C. Marrineal was a man of forty, upon whom the years had laid no
      bonds. A large fortune, founded by his able but illiterate father in the
      timber stretches of the Great Lakes region, and spread out into various
      profitable enterprises of mining, oil, cattle, and milling, provided him
      with a constantly increasing income which, though no amateur at spending,
      he could never quite overtake. Like many other hustlers of his day and
      opportunity, old Steve Marrineal had married a shrewd little shopgirl who
      had come up with him through the struggle by the slow, patient steps
      described in many of our most improving biographies. As frequently occurs,
      though it doesn&rsquo;t get into the biographies, she who had played a
      helpful role in adversity, could not withstand affluence. She bloated
      physically and mentally, and became the juicy and unsuspecting victim of a
      horde of parasites and flatterers who swarmed eagerly upon her, as soon as
      the rough and contemptuous protection of her husband was removed by the
      hand of a medical prodigy who advertised himself as the discoverer of a
      new and infallible cure for cancer, and whom Mrs. Marrineal, with an
      instinctive leaning toward quackery, had forced upon her spouse.
      Appraising his prospective widow with an accurate eye, the dying man left
      a testament bestowing the bulk of his fortune upon his son, with a few
      heavy income-producing properties for Mrs. Marrineal. Tertius Marrineal
      was devoted to his mother, with a jealous, pitying, and protective
      affection. This is popularly approved as the infallible mark of a good
      man. Tertius Marrineal was not a good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was there any particular reason why he should be. Boys who have a
      business pirate for father, and a weak-minded coddler for mother, seldom
      grow into prize exhibits. Young Marrineal did rather better than might
      have been expected, thanks to the presence at his birth-cradle of a robust
      little good-fairy named Self-Preservation, who never gets half the credit
      given to more picturesque but less important gift-bringers. He grew up
      with an instinctive sense of when to stop. Sometimes he stopped
      inopportunely. He quit several courses of schooling too soon, because he
      did not like the unyielding regimen of the institutions. When, a little,
      belated, he contrived to gain entrance to a small, old, and fashionable
      Eastern college, he was able, or perhaps willing, to go only halfway
      through his sophomore year. Two years in world travel with a
      well-accredited tutor seemed to offer an effectual and not too rigorous
      method of completing the process of mind-formation. Young Marrineal got a
      great deal out of that trip, though the result should perhaps be set down
      under the E of Experience rather than that of Erudition. The mentor also
      acquired experience, but it profited him little, as he died within the
      year after the completion of the trip, his health having been sacrificed
      in a too conscientious endeavor to keep even pace with his pupil. Young
      Marrineal did not suffer in health. He was a robust specimen. Besides,
      there was his good and protective fairy always ready with the flag of
      warning at the necessary moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Launched into the world after the elder Marrineal&rsquo;s death, Tertius
      interested himself in sundry of the businesses left by his father. Though
      they had been carefully devised and surrounded with safeguards, the heir
      managed to break into and improve several of them. The result was more
      money. After having gambled with fair luck, played the profuse libertine
      for a time, tried his hand at yachting, horse-racing, big-game hunting,
      and even politics, he successively tired of the first three, and was
      beaten at the last, but retained an unsatisfied hunger for it. To
      celebrate his fortieth birthday, he had bought a house on the eastern
      vista of Central Park, and drifted into a rather indeterminate life,
      identified with no special purpose, occupation, or set. Large though his
      fortune was, it was too much disseminated and he was too indifferent to
      it, for him to be conspicuous in the money game which constitutes New York&rsquo;s
      lists of High Endeavor. His reputation, in the city of careless
      reckonings, was vague, but just a trifle tarnished; good enough for the
      casual contacts which had hitherto made up his life, but offering
      difficulties should he wish to establish himself more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best clubs were closed to him; he had reached his possible summit
      along that path in achieving membership in the recently and superbly
      established Oligarchs Club, which was sumptuous, but over-vivid like a new
      Oriental rug. As to other social advancement, his record was an obstacle.
      Not that it was worse than, nor indeed nearly as bad as, that of many an
      established member of the inner circle; but the test for an outsider
      seeking admittance is naturally made more severe. Delavan Eyre, for
      example, an average sinner for one of his opportunities and standing, had
      certainly no better a general repute, and latterly a much more dubious one
      than Marrineal. But Eyre &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; of right.
    </p>
    <p>
      As sufficient indication of Marrineal&rsquo;s status, by the way, it may
      be pointed out that, while he knew Eyre quite well, it was highly
      improbable that he would ever know Mrs. Eyre, or, if he did fortuitously
      come to know her, that he would be able to improve upon the acquaintance.
      All this Marrineal himself well understood. But it must not be inferred
      that he resented it. He was far too much of a philosopher for that. It
      amused him as offering a new game to be played, more difficult certainly
      and inferentially more interesting than any of those which had hitherto
      enlisted his somewhat languid efforts. He appreciated also, though with a
      cynical disbelief in the logic of the situation, that he must polish up
      his reputation. He was on the new quest at the time when he overheard
      Banneker and Edmonds discuss the journalistic situation in Katie&rsquo;s
      restaurant, and had already determined upon his procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting between the two newspaper workers, Marrineal overtopped them both;
      the supple strength of Banneker as well as the gnarly slenderness of
      Edmonds. He gave an impression of loose-jointed and rather lazy power;
      also of quiet self-confidence. He began to talk at once, with the easy,
      drifting commentary of a man who had seen everything, measured much, and
      liked the glittering show. Both of the others, one his elder, the other
      his junior, felt the ready charm of the man. Both were content to listen,
      waiting for the clue to his intrusion which he had contrived to make not
      only inoffensive, but seemingly a casual act of good-fellowship. The clue
      was not afforded, but presently some shrewd opinion of the newcomer upon
      the local political situation set them both to discussion. Quite
      insensibly Marrineal withdrew from the conversation, sipping his coffee
      and listening with an effect of effortless amenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had a newspaper here that wasn&rsquo;t tied hard and fast,
      politically!&rdquo; cried Edmonds presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal fingered a specially fragrant cigar. &ldquo;But a newspaper must
      be tied to something, mustn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Otherwise
      it drifts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not to its reading public?&rdquo; suggested Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea. But can you tie to a public? Isn&rsquo;t the
      public itself adrift, like seaweed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blown about by the gales of politics.&rdquo; Edmonds accepted the
      figure. &ldquo;Well, the newspaper ought to be the gale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather that you gentlemen do not think highly of present
      journalistic conditions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You overheard our discussion,&rdquo; said Banneker bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal assented. &ldquo;It did not seem private. Katie&rsquo;s is a
      sort of free forum. That is why I come. I like to listen. Besides, it
      touched me pretty closely at one or two points.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two others turned toward him, waiting. He nodded, and took upon
      himself an air of well-pondered frankness. &ldquo;I expect to take a more
      active part in journalism from now on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds followed up the significant phrase. &ldquo;<i>More</i> active? You
      have newspaper interests?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically speaking, I own The Patriot. What do you gentlemen
      think of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who reads The Patriot?&rdquo; inquired Banneker. He was unprepared
      for the swift and surprised flash from Marrineal&rsquo;s fine eyes, as if
      some profoundly analytical or revealing suggestion had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty thousand men, women, and children. Not half enough, of
      course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a tenth enough, I would say, if I owned the paper. Nor are they
      the right kind of readers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you define them, then?&rdquo; asked Marrineal, still in
      that smooth voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small clerks. Race-track followers. People living in that class of
      tenements which call themselves flats. The more intelligent servants.
      Totally unimportant people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore a totally unimportant paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A paper can be important only through what it makes people believe
      and think. What possible difference can it make what The Patriot&rsquo;s
      readers think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were enough of them?&rdquo; suggested Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Besides, you&rsquo;ll never get enough of them, in the way you&rsquo;re
      running the paper now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;you,&rsquo; please,&rdquo; besought
      Marrineal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping my hands off. Watching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re going to take hold?&rdquo; queried Edmonds.
      &ldquo;Personally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I can find my formula&mdash;and the men to help me work
      it out,&rdquo; he added, after a pause so nicely emphasized that both his
      hearers had a simultaneous inkling of the reason for his being at their
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen newspapers run on formula before,&rdquo; muttered
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onto the rocks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invariably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the formulas were amateur formulas, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran of a quarter-century turned a mildly quizzical smile upon the
      adventurer into risky waters. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he jerked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal&rsquo;s face was quite serious as he took up the obvious
      implication. &ldquo;Where is the dividing line between professional and
      amateur in the newspaper business? You gentlemen will bear with me if I go
      into personal details a little. I suppose I&rsquo;ve always had the
      newspaper idea. When I was a youngster of twenty, I tried myself out. Got
      a job as a reporter in St. Louis. It was just a callow escapade. And of
      course it couldn&rsquo;t last. I was an undisciplined sort of cub. They
      fired me; quite right, too. But I did learn a little. And at least it
      educated me in one thing; how to read newspapers.&rdquo; He laughed
      lightly. &ldquo;Perhaps that is as nearly thorough an education as I&rsquo;ve
      ever had in anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather an art, newspaper reading,&rdquo; observed
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tried it, I gather. So have I, rather exhaustively in
      the last year. I&rsquo;ve been reading every paper in New York every day
      and all through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a job for an able-minded man,&rdquo; commented
      Edmonds, looking at him with a new respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It put eye-glasses on me. But if it dimmed my eyes, it enlightened
      my mind. The combined newspapers of New York do not cover the available
      field. They do not begin to cover it.... Did you say something, Mr.
      Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; said Banneker hastily.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good deal interested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; returned Marrineal with
      gravity. &ldquo;After I&rsquo;d made my estimate of what the newspapers
      publish and fail to publish, I canvassed the circulation lists and
      news-stands and made another discovery. There is a large potential reading
      public not yet tied up to any newspaper. It&rsquo;s waiting for the right
      paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imputation of amateurishness is retracted, with apologies,&rdquo;
      announced Russell Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accepted. Though there are amateur areas yet in my mind. I bought
      The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that represent one of the areas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It represents nothing, thus far, except what it has always
      represented, a hand-to-mouth policy and a financial deficit. But what&rsquo;s
      wrong with it from your point of view?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheap and nasty,&rdquo; was the veteran&rsquo;s succinct criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more so than The Sphere? The Sphere&rsquo;s successful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it plays fair with the main facts. It may gloss &rsquo;em
      up with a touch of sensationalism, like the oil on a barkeep&rsquo;s hair.
      But it does go after the facts, and pretty generally it presents &rsquo;em
      as found. The Patriot is fakey; clumsy at it, too. Any man arrested with
      more than five dollars in his pocket is a millionaire clubman. If Bridget
      O&rsquo;Flaherty jumps off Brooklyn Bridge, she becomes a prominent
      society woman with picture (hers or somebody else&rsquo;s) in The Patriot.
      And the cheapest little chorus-girl tart, who blackmails a broker&rsquo;s
      clerk with a breach of promise, gets herself called a &lsquo;distinguished
      actress&rsquo; and him a &lsquo;well-known financier.&rsquo; Why steal the
      Police Gazette&rsquo;s rouge and lip-stick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s what the readers want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. But at least give it to &rsquo;em well done. And cut out
      the printing of wild rumors as news. That doesn&rsquo;t get a paper
      anything in the long run. None of your readers have any faith in The
      Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any paper have the confidence of its public?&rdquo; returned
      Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched upon a sensitive spot, Edmonds cursed briefly. &ldquo;If it hasn&rsquo;t,
      it&rsquo;s because the public has a dam&rsquo;-fool fad for pretending it
      doesn&rsquo;t believe what it reads. Of course it believes it! Otherwise,
      how would it know who&rsquo;s president, or that the market sagged
      yesterday? This I-never-believe-what-I-read-in-the-papers&rsquo; guff
      makes me sick to the tips of my toes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the man who knows newspapers from the inside can disbelieve
      them scientifically,&rdquo; put in Banneker with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would <i>you</i> do with The Patriot if you had it?&rdquo;
      interrogated the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, I&rsquo;d try to make it interesting,&rdquo; was the prompt
      and simple reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, interesting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own purposes Banneker chose to misinterpret the purport of the
      question. &ldquo;So interesting that half a million people would have to
      read it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you could do that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it could be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me and try it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re offering me a place on The Patriot staff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Mr. Edmonds is joining.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman breathed a small cloud of blue vapor into the air together
      with the dispassionate query: &ldquo;Is that so? Hadn&rsquo;t heard of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My principle in business is to determine whether I want a man or an
      article, and then bid a price that can&rsquo;t be rejected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound,&rdquo; admitted the veteran. &ldquo;Perfectly sound. But I&rsquo;m
      not specially in need of money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m offering you opportunity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opportunity to handle big stories according to the facts as you see
      them. Not as you had to handle the Sippiac strike story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds set down his pipe. &ldquo;What did you think of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A masterpiece of hinting and suggestion and information for those
      who can read between the lines. Not many have the eye for it. With me you
      won&rsquo;t have to write between the lines. Not on labor or political
      questions, anyway. You&rsquo;re a Socialist, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re not going to make The Patriot a Socialist paper,
      are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people might call it that. I&rsquo;m going to make it a
      popular paper. It&rsquo;s going to be for the many against the few. How
      are you going to bring about Socialism?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! What better chance could you ask? A paper devoted to the
      interests of the masses, and willing to print facts. I want you to do the
      same sort of thing that you&rsquo;ve been doing for The Courier; a job of
      handling the big, general stories. You&rsquo;ll be responsible to me
      alone. The salary will be a third higher than you are now getting. Think
      it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought. I&rsquo;m bought,&rdquo; said Russell Edmonds.
      He resumed his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Socialist, in the party sense. Besides a Socialist
      paper in New York has no chance of big circulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, The Patriot isn&rsquo;t going to tag itself. Politically it
      will be independent. Its policy will be socialistic only in that it will
      be for labor rather than capital and for the under dog as against the
      upper dog. It certainly won&rsquo;t tie up to the Socialist Party or
      advocate its principles. It&rsquo;s for fair play and education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your purpose?&rdquo; demanded Banneker. &ldquo;Money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a very comfortable income,&rdquo; replied Marrineal
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Political advancement? Influence? Want to pull the wires?&rdquo;
      persisted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game. I&rsquo;m out of employment and tired of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think I could be of use in your plan? But you don&rsquo;t
      know much about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal murmured smilingly something indefinite but complimentary as to
      Banneker&rsquo;s reputation on Park Row; but this was by no means a fair
      index to what he knew about Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, that prematurely successful reporter would have been surprised at
      the extent to which Marrineal&rsquo;s private investigations had gone. Not
      only was the purchaser of The Patriot apprised of Banneker&rsquo;s
      professional career in detail, but he knew of his former employment, and
      also of his membership in The Retreat, which he regarded with perplexity
      and admiration. Marrineal was skilled at ascertainments. He made a
      specialty of knowing all about people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mr. Edmonds on roving commission and you to handle the big
      local stuff,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;we should have the nucleus of a
      news organization. Like him, you would be responsible to me alone. And, of
      course, it would be made worth your while. What do you think? Will you
      join us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; There was no slightest hint of disappointment, surprise,
      or resentment in Marrineal&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;Do you mind giving me
      the reason?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be a reporter on The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this would hardly be reporting. At least, a very specialized
      and important type.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter, I don&rsquo;t care to be a reporter on any paper
      much longer. Besides, you need me&mdash;or some one&mdash;in another
      department more than in the news section.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the editorials,&rdquo; was the inference which
      Marrineal drew from this, and correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re solemn flapdoodle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. Occasionally I write them myself and send them in quietly.
      It isn&rsquo;t known yet that I own the property; so I don&rsquo;t appear
      at the office. Mine are quite as solemn and flapdoodlish as the others. To
      which quality do you object the most?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solemnity. It&rsquo;s the blight of editorial expression. All the
      papers suffer from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wouldn&rsquo;t have the editorial page modeled on that of
      any of our contemporaries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;d try to make it interesting. There isn&rsquo;t a page
      in town that the average man-in-the-street-car can read without a painful
      effort at thought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editorials are supposed to be for thinking men,&rdquo; put in
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the thinking easy, then. Don&rsquo;t make it hard, with heavy
      words and a didactic manner. Talk to &rsquo;em. You&rsquo;re trying to
      reach for their brain mechanism. Wrong idea. Reach for their coat-lapels.
      Hook a finger in the buttonholes and tell &rsquo;em something about common
      things they never stopped to consider. Our editorializers are always
      tucking their hands into their oratorical bosoms and discoursing in a
      sonorous voice about freight differentials as an element in stabilizing
      the market. How does that affect Jim Jones? Why, Jim turns to the sporting
      page. But if you say to him casually, in print, &lsquo;Do you realize that
      every woman who brings a child into the world shows more heroism than
      Teddy Roosevelt when he charged up San Juan Hill?&rsquo;&mdash;what&rsquo;ll
      Jim do about that? Turn to the sporting page just the same, maybe. But
      after he&rsquo;s absorbed the ball-scores, he&rsquo;ll turn back to the
      editorial. You see, he never thought about Mrs. Jones just that way
      before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentimentalism,&rdquo; observed Marrineal. &ldquo;Not altogether
      original, either.&rdquo; But he did not speak as a critic. Rather as one
      pondering upon new vistas of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t an editorial be sentimental about something
      besides the starry flag and the boyhood of its party&rsquo;s candidate?
      Original? I shouldn&rsquo;t worry overmuch about that. All my time would
      be occupied in trying to be interesting. After I got &rsquo;em interested,
      I could perhaps be instructive. Very cautiously, though. But always man to
      man: that&rsquo;s the editorial trick, as I see it. Not preacher to
      congregation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your editorials, son?&rdquo; asked the veteran Edmonds
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked up.&rdquo; Banneker tapped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the place of their birth?&rdquo; smiled Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want too much credit for my idea. A fair share of
      it belongs to a bald-headed and snarling old nondescript whom I met one
      day in the Public Library and shall probably never meet again anywhere.
      Somebody had pointed me out&mdash;it was after that shooting mess&mdash;and
      the old fellow came up to me and growled out, &lsquo;Employed on a
      newspaper?&rsquo; I admitted it. &lsquo;What do you know about news?&rsquo;
      was his next question. Well, I&rsquo;m always open to any fresh slants on
      the business, so I asked him politely what he knew. He put on an
      expression like a prayerful owl and said, &lsquo;Suppose I came into your
      office with the information that a destructive plague was killing off the
      earthworms?&rsquo; Naturally, I thought one of the librarians had put up a
      joke on me; so I said, &lsquo;Refer you to the Anglers&rsquo; Department
      of the All-Outdoors Monthly.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is as far as you could see
      into the information?&rsquo; he said severely. I had to confess that it
      was. &lsquo;And you are supposed to be a judge of news!&rsquo; he snarled.
      Well, he seemed so upset about it that I tried to be soothing by asking
      him if there was an earthworm pestilence in progress. &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
      answers he, and lucky for you. For if the earthworms all died, so would
      you and the rest of us, including your accursed brood of newspapers, which
      would be some compensation. Read Darwin,&rsquo; croaks the old bird, and
      calls me a callow fool, and flits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he? Did you find out?&rdquo; asked Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some scientific grubber from the museum. I looked up the Darwin
      book and decided that he was right; not Darwin; the old croaker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, that was not precisely news,&rdquo; pointed out Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theoretical news. I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; pursued Banneker,
      struck with a new idea, &ldquo;that that isn&rsquo;t the formula for
      editorial writing; theoretical news. Supplemented by analytical news, of
      course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophizing over Darwin and dead worms would hardly inspire half
      a million readers to follow your editorial output, day after day.&rdquo;
      Marrineal delivered his opinion suavely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if written in the usual style, suggesting a conscientious
      rehash of the encyclopedia. But suppose it were done differently, and with
      a caption like this, &lsquo;Why Does an Angle-Worm Wriggle?&rsquo; Set
      that in irregular type that weaved and squirmed across the column, and
      Jones-in-the-street-car would at least look at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! I should think so,&rdquo; assented Marrineal. &ldquo;And
      call for the police.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, if that is too sensational,&rdquo; continued Banneker, warming
      up, &ldquo;we could head it &lsquo;Charles Darwin Would Never Go Fishing,
      Because&rsquo; and a heavy dash after &lsquo;because.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fakey,&rdquo; pronounced Edmonds. &ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t know
      that there&rsquo;s any harm in that kind of faking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely a trick to catch the eye. I don&rsquo;t know whether Darwin
      ever went fishing or not. Probably he did if only for his researches. But,
      in essentials, I&rsquo;m giving &rsquo;em a truth; a big truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solemn sermonizers would call it the inter-relations of life or
      something to that effect. What I&rsquo;m after is to coax &rsquo;em to
      think a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About angle-worms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About anything. It&rsquo;s the process I&rsquo;m after. Only let me
      start them thinking about evolution and pretty soon I&rsquo;ll have them
      thinking about the relations of modern society&mdash;and thinking my way.
      Five hundred thousand people, all thinking in the way we told &rsquo;em to
      think&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could elect Willis Enderby mayor of New York,&rdquo; interjected
      the practical Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal, whose face had become quite expressionless, gave a little
      start. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Enderby of the Law Enforcement Society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Yes. Of course. Or any one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any one else,&rdquo; agreed Banneker, catching a quick, informed
      glance from Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, your scheme seems a little fantastic to me,&rdquo;
      pronounced the owner of The Patriot. &ldquo;But that may be only because
      it&rsquo;s new. It might be worth trying out.&rdquo; He reverted again to
      his expressionless reverie, out of which exhaled the observation: &ldquo;I
      wonder what the present editorial staff could do with that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to infer that you intend to help yourself to my idea?&rdquo;
      inquired Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marrineal aroused himself hastily from his editorial dream. Though by
      no means a fearful person, he was uncomfortably sensible of a menace,
      imminent and formidable. It was not in Banneker&rsquo;s placid face, nor
      in the unaltered tone wherein the pertinent query was couched.
      Nevertheless, the object of that query became aware that young Banneker
      was not a person to be trifled with. He now went on, equably to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if you do, it might be as well to give me the chance of
      developing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; with which Marrineal responded to
      this reasonable suggestion, was just a little bit over-prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me ten days. No: two weeks, and I&rsquo;ll be ready to show my
      wares. Where can I find you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal gave a telephone address. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in the book,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;It will always get me between 9 A.M. and noon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of matters journalistic, Marrineal lapsing tactfully into the
      role of attentive listener again, until there appeared in the lower room a
      dark-faced man of thirty-odd, spruce and alert, who, upon sighting them,
      came confidently forward. Marrineal ordered him a drink and presented him
      to the two journalists as Mr. Ely Ives. As Mr. Ives, it appeared, was in
      the secret of Marrineal&rsquo;s journalistic connection, the talk was
      resumed, becoming more general. Presently Marrineal consulted his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going up to the After-Theater Club to-night?&rdquo;
      he asked Banneker, and, on receiving a negative reply, made his adieus and
      went out with Ives to his waiting car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker and Edmonds looked at each other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t both speak
      at once,&rdquo; chuckled Banneker. &ldquo;What do <i>you</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of him? He&rsquo;s a smooth article. Very smooth. But I&rsquo;ve
      seen &rsquo;em before that were straight as well as smooth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bland,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;Bland with a surpassing
      blandness. A blandness amounting to blandeur, as grandness in the highest
      degree becomes grandeur. I like that word,&rdquo; Banneker chucklingly
      approved himself. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t use it in an editorial, one
      of those editorials that our genial friend was going to appropriate so
      coolly. A touch of the pirate in him, I think. I like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you have to. He makes himself likable. What do you figure Mr.
      Ely Ives to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henchman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him uptown, once or twice. He has some reputation
      as an amateur juggler.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him, too. But he doesn&rsquo;t remember me or he wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been so pleasant,&rdquo; said the veteran, committing two errors in
      one sentence, for Ely Ives had remembered him perfectly, and in any case
      would never have exhibited any unnecessary rancor in his carefully trained
      manner. &ldquo;Wrote a story about him once. He&rsquo;s quite a betting
      man; some say a sure-thing bettor. Several years ago Bob Wessington was
      giving one of his famous booze parties on board his yacht &lsquo;The
      Water-Wain,&rsquo; and this chap was in on it somehow. When everybody was
      tanked up, they got to doing stunts and he bet a thousand with Wessington
      he could swarm up the backstay to the masthead. Two others wished in for a
      thousand apiece, and he cleaned up the lot. It cut his hands up pretty
      bad, but that was cheap at three thousand. Afterwards it turned out that
      he&rsquo;d been practicing that very climb in heavy gloves, down in South
      Brooklyn. So I wrote the story. He came back with a threat of a libel
      suit. Fool bluff, for it wasn&rsquo;t libelous. But I looked up his record
      a little and found he was an ex-medical student, from Chicago, where he&rsquo;d
      been on The Chronicle for a while. He quit that to become a press-agent
      for a group of oil-gamblers, and must have done some good selling himself,
      for he had money when he landed here. To the best of my knowledge he is
      now a sort of lookout for the Combination Traction people, with some
      connection with the City Illuminating Company on the side. It&rsquo;s a
      secret sort of connection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker made the world-wide symbolistic finger-shuffle of money-handling.
      &ldquo;Legislative?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. But it&rsquo;s more keeping a watch on publicity and
      politics. He gives himself out as a man-about-town, and is supposed to
      make a good thing out of the market. Maybe he does, though I notice that
      generally the market makes a good thing out of the smart guy who tries to
      beat it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a particularly desirable person for a colleague.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if he&rsquo;d be Marrineal&rsquo;s colleague exactly. The
      inside of the newspaper isn&rsquo;t his game. More likely he&rsquo;s
      making himself attractive and useful to Marrineal just to find out what he&rsquo;s
      up to with his paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him something interesting if I get hold of that
      editorial page.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son, are you up to it, d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo; asked Edmonds with
      affectionate solicitude. &ldquo;It takes a lot of experience to handle
      policies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you with me, won&rsquo;t I, Pop? Besides, if my
      little scheme works, I&rsquo;m going out to gather experience like a bee
      after honey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a queer team, we three,&rdquo; mused the veteran,
      shaking his bony head, as he leaned forward over his tiny pipe. His
      protuberant forehead seemed to overhang the idea protectively. Or perhaps
      threateningly. &ldquo;None of us looks at a newspaper from the same angle
      or as the same kind of a machine as the others view it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind our views. They&rsquo;ll assimilate. What about his?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I wish I knew. But he wants something. Like all of us.&rdquo; A
      shade passed across the clearly modeled severity of the face. Edmonds
      sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but that I&rsquo;m too old for this kind
      of experiment. Yet I&rsquo;ve fallen for the temptation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; said Banneker with abrupt irrelevance, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      a line from Emerson that you make me think of when you look like that.
      &lsquo;His sad lucidity of soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? But it isn&rsquo;t Emerson. It&rsquo;s Matthew Arnold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you find time for poetry, you old wheelhorse! Never mind;
      you ought to be painted as the living embodiment of that line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or as a wooden automaton, jumping at the end of a special wire from
      our correspondent.&rsquo; Ban, can you see Marrineal&rsquo;s hand on a
      wire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s plain enough to be visible, I&rsquo;m underestimating
      his tact. I&rsquo;d like to have a lock of his hair to dream on to-night.
      I&rsquo;m off to think things over, Pop. Good-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker walked uptown, through dimmed streets humming with the harmonic
      echoes of the city&rsquo;s never-ending life, faint and delicate. He
      stopped at Sherry&rsquo;s, and at a small table in the side room sat down
      with a bottle of ale, a cigarette, and some stationery. When he rose, it
      was to mail a letter. That done, he went back to his costly little
      apartment upon which the rent would be due in a few days. He had the cash
      in hand: that was all right. As for the next month, he wondered humorously
      whether he would have the wherewithal to meet the recurring bill, not to
      mention others. However, the consideration was not weighty enough to keep
      him sleepless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom kindly provides its own patent shock-absorbers to all the various
      organisms of nature; otherwise the whole regime would perish. Necessarily
      a newspaper is among the best protected of organisms against shock: it
      deals, as one might say, largely in shocks, and its hand is subdued to
      what it works in. Nevertheless, on the following noon The Ledger office
      was agitated as it hardly would have been had Brooklyn Bridge fallen into
      the East River, or the stalest mummy in the Natural History Museum shown
      stirrings of life. A word was passing from eager mouth to incredulous ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had resigned.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking out of the front window, into the decorum of Grove Street, Mrs.
      Brashear could hardly credit the testimony of her glorified eyes. Could
      the occupant of the taxi indeed be Mr. Banneker whom, a few months before
      and most sorrowfully, she had sacrificed to the stern respectability of
      the house? And was it possible, as the very elegant trunk inscribed
      &ldquo;E.B.&mdash;New York City&rdquo; indicated, that he was coming back
      as a lodger? For the first time in her long and correct professional
      career, the landlady felt an unqualified bitterness in the fact that all
      her rooms were occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupant of the taxi jumped out and ran lightly up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you do, Mrs. Brashear. Am I still excommunicated?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Banneker! I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad to see you. If I could
      tell you how often I&rsquo;ve blamed myself&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget all that. The point is I&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! I do hate not to take you in. But there isn&rsquo;t a
      spot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got my old room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hainer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hainer? Let&rsquo;s turn him out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would in a minute,&rdquo; declared the ungrateful landlady to
      whom Mr. Hainer had always been a model lodger. &ldquo;But the law&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll fix Hainer if you&rsquo;ll fix the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the bewildered Mrs. Brashear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room? Just as it used to be. Bed, table, couple of chairs,
      bookshelf.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Hainer&rsquo;s things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Store &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;ll be for only a month.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his trunk, Banneker sallied forth in smiling confidence to accost
      and transfer the unsuspecting occupant of his room. To achieve this, it
      was necessary only to convince the object of the scheme that the
      incredible offer was made in good faith; an apartment in the &ldquo;swell&rdquo;
      Regalton, luxuriously furnished, service and breakfast included, rent free
      for a whole month. A fairy-tale for the prosaic Hainer to be gloated over
      for the rest of his life! Very quietly, for this was part of the bargain,
      the middle-aged accountant moved to his new glories and Banneker took his
      old quarters. It was all accomplished that evening. The refurnishing was
      finished on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you doing it for, if I may be so bold, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
      asked the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, quiet, and work,&rdquo; he answered gayly. &ldquo;Just to be
      where nobody can find me, while I do a job.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as in the old, jobless days, Banneker settled down to concentrated
      and happy toil. Always a creature of Spartan self-discipline in the matter
      of work, he took on, in this quiet and remote environment, new energies.
      Miss Westlake, recipient of the output as it came from the hard-driven
      pen, was secretly disquieted. Could any human being maintain such a pace
      without collapse? Day after day, the devotee of the third-floor-front rose
      at seven, breakfasted from a thermos bottle and a tin box, and set upon
      his writing; lunched hastily around the corner, returned with armfuls of
      newspapers which he skimmed as a preliminary to a second long bout with
      his pen; allowed himself an hour for dinner, and came back to resume the
      never-ending task. As in the days of the &ldquo;Eban&rdquo; sketches, now
      on the press for book publication, it was write, rewrite, and re-rewrite,
      the typed sheets coming back to Miss Westlake amended, interlined,
      corrected, but always successively shortened and simplified. Profitable,
      indeed, for the solicitous little typist; but she ventured, after a
      fortnight of it, to remonstrate on the score of ordinary prudence.
      Banneker laughed, though he was touched, too, by her interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m indestructible,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;But next
      week I shall run around outside a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Field-work, I believe they call it. The Elysian Fields of Manhattan
      Island. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll come with me sometimes and see that I attend
      properly to my recreation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity as well as a mere personal interest prompted her to accept. She
      did not understand the purpose of these strange and vivid writings
      committed to her hands, so different from any of the earlier of Mr.
      Banneker&rsquo;s productions; so different, indeed, from anything that she
      had hitherto seen in any print. Nor did she derive full enlightenment from
      her Elysian journeys with the writer. They seemed to be casual if not
      aimless. The pair traveled about on street-cars, L trains, Fifth Avenue
      buses, dined in queer, crowded restaurants, drank in foreign-appearing
      beer-halls, went to meetings, to Cooper Union forums, to the Art Gallery,
      the Aquarium, the Museum of Natural History, to dances in East-Side halls:
      and everywhere, by virtue of his easy and graceful good-fellowship,
      Banneker picked up acquaintances, entered into their discussions, listened
      to their opinions and solemn dicta, agreeing or controverting with equal
      good-humor, and all, one might have carelessly supposed, in the idlest
      spirit of a light-minded Haroun al Raschid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it all about, if you don&rsquo;t mind telling?&rdquo; asked
      his companion as he bade her good-night early one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find what people naturally talk about,&rdquo; was the ready
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk with them about what interests them. In print.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t Elysian-fielding at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s work. Hard work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you do after it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sit up and write for a while.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! It&rsquo;s good for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, it was better for him than the alternative of trying to sleep
      without the anodyne of complete exhaustion. For again, his hours were
      haunted by the not-to-be-laid spirit of Io Welland. As in those earlier
      days when, with hot eyes and set teeth, he had sent up his nightly prayer
      for deliverance from the powers of the past&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven shield and keep us free From the wizard, Memory And his
      cruel necromancies!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      she came back to her old sway over his soul, and would not be exorcised.&mdash;So
      he drugged his brain against her with the opiate of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of his four weeks had passed when Banneker began to whistle at his
      daily stent. Thereafter small boys, grimy with printer&rsquo;s ink, called
      occasionally, received instructions and departed, and there emanated from
      his room the clean and bitter smell of paste, and the clip of shears.
      Despite all these new activities, the supply of manuscript for Miss
      Westlake&rsquo;s typewriter never failed. One afternoon Banneker knocked
      at the door, asked her if she thought she could take dictation direct, and
      on her replying doubtfully that she could try, transferred her and her
      machine to his den, which was littered with newspapers, proof-sheets, and
      foolscap. Walking to and fro with a sheet of the latter inscribed with a
      few notes in his hand, the hermit proceeded to deliver himself to the
      briskly clicking writing machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-em dash,&rdquo; said he at the close. &ldquo;That seemed to
      go fairly well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you training me?&rdquo; asked Miss Westlake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m training myself. It&rsquo;s easier to write, but it&rsquo;s
      quicker to talk. Some day I&rsquo;m going to be really busy&rdquo;&mdash;Miss
      Westlake gasped&mdash;&ldquo;and time-saving will be important. Shall we
      try it again to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;I could brush up my shorthand and take it quicker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know shorthand?&rdquo; He looked at her contemplatively.
      &ldquo;Would you care to take a regular position, paying rather better
      than this casual work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you?&rdquo; asked Miss Westlake in a tone which constituted a
      sufficient acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Always supposing that I land one myself. I&rsquo;m in a big
      gamble, and these,&rdquo; he swept a hand over the littered accumulations,
      &ldquo;are my cards. If they&rsquo;re good enough, I&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are good enough,&rdquo; said Miss Westlake with simple faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a young man, jobless, highly unsettled of prospects, the ratio of
      whose debts to his assets was inversely to what it should have been,
      Banneker presented a singularly care-free aspect when, at 11 A.M. of a
      rainy morning, he called at Mr. Tertius Marrineal&rsquo;s Fifth Avenue
      house, bringing with him a suitcase heavily packed. Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s
      personal Jap took over the burden and conducted it and its owner to a
      small rear room at the top of the house. Banneker apprehended at the first
      glance that this was a room for work. Mr. Marrineal, rising from behind a
      broad, glass-topped table with his accustomed amiable smile, also looked
      workmanlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have decided to come with us, I hope,&rdquo; said he pleasantly
      enough, yet with a casual politeness which might have been meant to
      suggest a measure of indifference. Banneker at once caught the note of
      bargaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think my ideas are worth my price,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble to show goods,&rdquo; Banneker said, unclasping the
      suitcase. He preferred to keep the talk in light tone until his time came.
      From the case he extracted two close-packed piles of news-print, folded in
      half.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coals to Newcastle,&rdquo; smiled Marrineal. &ldquo;These seem to
      be copies of The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exact copies. Try this one.&rdquo; Selecting an issue at random
      he passed it to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal went into it carefully, turning from the front page to the
      inside, and again farther in the interior, without comment. Nor did he
      speak at once when he came to the editorial page. But he glanced up at
      Banneker before settling down to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; he said presently, in a non-committal
      manner. &ldquo;Have you more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Banneker transferred to the table-top the remainder of the
      suitcase&rsquo;s contents. Choosing half a dozen at random, Marrineal
      turned each inside out and studied the editorial columns. His expression
      did not in any degree alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had these editorials set up in type to suit yourself, I
      take it,&rdquo; he observed after twenty minutes of perusal; &ldquo;and
      have pasted them into the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the double-column measure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More attractive to the eye. It stands out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the heavy type for the same reason?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I want to make &rsquo;em just as easy to read as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re easy to read,&rdquo; admitted the other. &ldquo;Are
      they all yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine&mdash;and others&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal looked a bland question. Banneker answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up and down in the highways and the low-ways, Mr.
      Marrineal, taking those editorials from the speech of the ordinary folk
      who talk about their troubles and their pleasures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Straight from the throbbing heart of the people.
      Jones-in-the-street-car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Jones. Don&rsquo;t forget her. She&rsquo;ll read &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t, it won&rsquo;t be because they don&rsquo;t

      with a vengeance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I picked that up from a fat old party who was advising a thin
      young wife at a fish-stall. &lsquo;Give&rsquo;m his food <i>right</i> an&rsquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find more moralizing on booze if you look farther. It&rsquo;s
      one of the subjects they talk most about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Sardine is Dead: Therefore More Comfortable Than You,
      Mr. Straphanger,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go up in the rush-hour L any day and you&rsquo;ll hear that
      editorial with trimmings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;Mr. Flynn Owes You a Yacht Ride&rsquo; is of the same
      order, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If it had been practicable, I&rsquo;d have had some insets
      with that: a picture of Flynn, a cut of his new million-dollar yacht, and
      a table showing the twenty per cent dividends that the City Illuminating
      Company pays by over-taxing Jones on his lighting and heating. That would
      almost tell the story without comment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Still making it easy for them to read.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal ran over a number of other captions, sensational, personal,
      invocative, and always provocative: &ldquo;Man, Why Hasn&rsquo;t Your Wife
      Divorced You?&rdquo; &ldquo;John L. Sullivan, the Great Unknown.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Why Has the Ornithorhyncus Got a Beak?&rdquo; &ldquo;If You Must
      Sell Your Vote, Ask a Fair Price For It.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t Play,
      You Kiddies: It&rsquo;s a Crime: Ask Judge Croban.&rdquo; &ldquo;Socrates,
      Confucius, Buddha, Christ; All Dead, But&mdash;!!!&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      Inventor of Goose-Plucking Was the First Politician. They&rsquo;re At It
      Yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;How Much Would You Pay a Man to Think For You?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Air Doesn&rsquo;t Cost Much: Have You Got Enough to Breathe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; said the owner of The Patriot, &ldquo;is taken
      from what people talk and think about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t some of it reach out into the realm of what Mr.
      Banneker thinks they <i>ought</i> to talk and think about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed. &ldquo;Discovered! Oh, I won&rsquo;t pretend but what I
      propose to teach &rsquo;em thinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can do that and make them think our way&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Give me place for my fulcrum,&rsquo; said Archimedes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s an editorial you won&rsquo;t write very soon. One
      more detail. You&rsquo;ve thrown up words and phrases into capital letters
      all through for emphasis. I doubt whether that will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you shattered enough traditions without that? The
      public doesn&rsquo;t want to be taught with a pointer. I&rsquo;m afraid
      that&rsquo;s rather too much of an innovation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No innovation at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s adapted plagiarism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harper&rsquo;s Monthly of the seventy&rsquo;s. I used to have some
      odd volumes in my little library. There was a department of funny
      anecdote; and the point of every joke, lest some obtuse reader should
      overlook it, was printed in italics. That,&rdquo; chuckled Banneker,
      &ldquo;was in the days when we used to twit the English with lacking a
      sense of humor. However, the method has its advantages. It&rsquo;s
      fool-proof. Therefore I helped myself to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re aiming at the weak-minded?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At anybody who can assimilate simple ideas plainly expressed,&rdquo;
      declared the other positively. &ldquo;There ought to be four million of
      &rsquo;em within reaching distance of The Patriot&rsquo;s presses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your proposition&mdash;though you haven&rsquo;t made any as yet&mdash;is
      that we lead our editorial page daily with matter such as this. Am I
      correct?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Make a clean sweep of the present editorials. Substitute mine.
      One a day will be quite enough for their minds to work on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t fill the page,&rdquo; objected the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cartoon. Column of light comment. Letters from readers. That will,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker with severe brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worth trying,&rdquo; mused Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worth, to a moribund paper, almost anything.&rdquo; The
      tone was significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are prepared to join our staff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On suitable terms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought of offering you,&rdquo; Marrineal paused for better
      effect, &ldquo;one hundred and fifty dollars a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was annoyed. That was no more than he could earn, with a little
      outside work, on The Ledger. He had thought of asking two hundred and
      fifty. Now he said promptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those editorials are worth three hundred a week to any paper. As a
      starter,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pained and patient smile overspread Marrineal&rsquo;s regular features.
      &ldquo;The Patriot&rsquo;s leader-writer draws a hundred at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole page costs barely three hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is overpaid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a comparative novice,&rdquo; observed Marrineal without rancor,
      &ldquo;you do not lack self-confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the goods,&rdquo; said Banneker evenly. &ldquo;It is for
      you to decide whether they are worth the price asked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s where the trouble is,&rdquo; confessed Marrineal.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They might be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker made his proposition. &ldquo;You spoke of my being a novice. I
      admit the weak spot. I want more experience. You can afford to try this
      out for six months. In fact, you can&rsquo;t afford not to. Something has
      got to be done with The Patriot, and soon. It&rsquo;s losing ground daily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; returned Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the news-stands and circulation lists are mistaken, too,&rdquo;
      retorted the other. &ldquo;Would you care to see my figures?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal waved away the suggestion with an easy gesture which surrendered
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;m backing the new editorial idea to get
      circulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my money,&rdquo; pointed out Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t save you the money. But I can spread it for you, that
      three hundred dollars.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, spread it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charge half to editorial page: half to the news department.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of what services to the news department?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General. That is where I expect to get my finishing experience. I&rsquo;ve
      had enough reporting. Now I&rsquo;m after the special work; a little
      politics, a little dramatic criticism; a touch of sports; perhaps some
      book-reviewing and financial writing. And, of course, an apprenticeship in
      the Washington office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten the London correspondence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not this was sardonic, Banneker did not trouble to determine.
      &ldquo;Too far away, and not time enough,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Later,
      perhaps, I can try that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while you are doing all these things who is to carry out the
      editorial idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal stared. &ldquo;Both? At the same time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No living man could do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do it. I&rsquo;ve proved it to myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How and where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I last saw you. Now that I&rsquo;ve got the hang of it, I can
      do an editorial in the morning, another in the afternoon, a third in the
      evening. Two and a half days a week will turn the trick. That leaves the
      rest of the time for the other special jobs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t live out the six months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insure my life if you like,&rdquo; laughed Banneker. &ldquo;Work
      will never kill me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal, sitting with inscrutable face turned half away from his
      visitor, was beginning, &ldquo;If I meet you on the salary,&rdquo; when
      Banneker broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until you hear the rest. I&rsquo;m asking that for six months
      only. Thereafter I propose to drop the non-editorial work and with it the
      salary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what substitute?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A salary based upon one cent a week for every unit of circulation
      put on from the time the editorials begin publication.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds innocent,&rdquo; remarked Marrineal. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      as innocent as it sounds,&rdquo; he added after a penciled reckoning on
      the back of an envelope. &ldquo;In case we increase fifty thousand, you
      will be drawing twenty-five thousand a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Won&rsquo;t it be worth the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it would,&rdquo; admitted Marrineal dubiously. &ldquo;Of
      course fifty thousand in six months is an extreme assumption. Suppose the
      circulation stands still?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I starve. It&rsquo;s a gamble. But it strikes me that I&rsquo;m
      giving the odds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you amuse yourself for an hour?&rdquo; asked Marrineal
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered Banneker hesitantly. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d
      turn me loose in your library. I&rsquo;d find something to put in the time
      on there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied his host
      apologetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of the low-brow species in my reading
      tastes, or else rather severely practical. You&rsquo;ll find some
      advertising data that may interest you, however.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hour&mdash;which grew to an hour and a half&mdash;spent in the
      library, Banneker sought to improve his uncertain conception of his
      prospective employer&rsquo;s habit and trend of mind. The hope of
      revelation was not borne out by the reading matter at hand. Most of it
      proved to be technical.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to Marrineal&rsquo;s den, he found Russell Edmonds with
      the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, son, you&rsquo;ve turned the trick,&rdquo; was the veteran&rsquo;s
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Banneker, and Marrineal
      was shrewd enough to note the instinctive shading of manner when expert
      spoke to expert. He was an outsider, being merely the owner. It amused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;re dam&rsquo; good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they dam&rsquo; good?&rdquo; returned Banneker
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll save the day if anything can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely my own humble opinion if a layman may speak,&rdquo; put
      in Marrineal. &ldquo;Mr. Banneker, shall I have the contract drawn up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on my account. I don&rsquo;t need any. If I haven&rsquo;t made
      myself so essential after the six months that you <i>have</i> to keep me
      on, I&rsquo;ll want to quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still in the gambling mood,&rdquo; smiled Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two practical journalists left, making an appointment to spend the
      following morning with Marrineal in planning policy and methods. Banneker
      went back to his apartment and wrote Miss Camilla Van Arsdale all about
      it, in exultant mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brains to let! But I&rsquo;ve got my price. And I&rsquo;ll get a
      higher one: the highest, if I can hold out. It&rsquo;s all due to you. If
      you hadn&rsquo;t kept my mind turned to things worth while in the early
      days at Manzanita, with your music and books and your taste for all that
      is fine, I&rsquo;d have fallen into a rut. It&rsquo;s success, the first
      real taste. I like it. I love it. And I owe it all to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale, yearning over the boyish outburst, smiled and sighed
      and mused and was vaguely afraid, with quasi-maternal fears. She, too, had
      had her taste of success; a marvelous stimulant, bubbling with inspiration
      and incitement. But for all except the few who are strong and steadfast,
      there lurks beneath the effervescence a subtle poison.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not being specially gifted with originality of either thought or
      expression, Mr. Herbert Cressey stopped Banneker outside of his apartment
      with the remark made and provided for the delayed reunion of frequent
      companions: &ldquo;Well I thought you were dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of keeping to the same level Banneker replied cheerfully: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been all this while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you Monday last? Didn&rsquo;t see you at Sherry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the week before? You weren&rsquo;t at The Retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working, also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the week before that? Nobody&rsquo;s seen so much&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working. Working. Working.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped in at your roost and your new man told me you were away
      and might be gone indefinitely. Funny chap, your new man. Mysterious sort
      of manner. Where&rsquo;d you pick him up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord! Hainer!&rdquo; exclaimed Banneker appreciatively. &ldquo;Well,
      he told the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look pulled down, too, by Jove!&rdquo; commented Cressey,
      concern on his sightly face. &ldquo;Ridin&rsquo; for a fall, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a test. I&rsquo;m going to let up next week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; proffered Cressey. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do a
      day together. Say Wednesday, eh? I&rsquo;m giving a little dinner that
      night. And, oh, I say! By the way&mdash;no: never mind that. You&rsquo;ll
      come, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;ll be at The Retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: I&rsquo;ll come. I&rsquo;ll be playing polo that afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if Jim Maitland sees you first. He&rsquo;s awfully sore on you
      for not turning up to practice. Had a place for you on the second team.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want it. I&rsquo;m through with polo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! What the devil&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work, I tell you. Next season I may be able to play. For the
      present I&rsquo;m off everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they made you <i>all</i> the editors of The Ledger in one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off The Ledger, too. Give you all the painful details
      Wednesday. Fare-you-well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General disgust and wrath pervaded the atmosphere of the polo field when
      Banneker, making his final appearance on Wednesday, broke the news to
      Maitland, Densmore, and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you were beginning to know one end of your stick from the
      other,&rdquo; growled the irate team captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker played well that afternoon because he played recklessly. Lack of
      practice sometimes works out that way; as if luck took charge of a man&rsquo;s
      play and carried him through. Three of the five goals made by the second
      team fell to his mallet, and he left the field heartily cursed on all
      sides for his recalcitrancy in throwing himself away on work when the
      sport of sports called him. Regretful, yet well pleased with himself, he
      had his bath, his one, lone drink, and leisurely got into his evening
      clothes. Cressey met him at the entry to the guest&rsquo;s lounge giving
      on the general dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damned if you&rsquo;re not a good-lookin&rsquo; chap, Ban!&rdquo;
      he declared with something like envy in his voice. &ldquo;Thinning down a
      bit gives you a kind of look. No wonder Mertoun puts in his best licks on
      your clothes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which reminds me that I&rsquo;ve neglected even Mertoun,&rdquo;
      smiled Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead in, will you? I&rsquo;ve got to bone some feller for a
      fresh collar. My cousin&rsquo;s in there somewhere. Mrs. Rogerson Lyle
      from Philadelphia. She&rsquo;s a pippin in pink. Go in and tell on
      yourself, and order her a cocktail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeking to follow the vague direction, Banneker turned to the left and
      entered a dim side room. No pippin in pink disclosed herself. But a
      gracious young figure in black was bending over a table looking at a
      magazine, the long, free curve of her back turned toward him. He advanced.
      The woman said in a soft voice that shook him to the depths of his soul:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back so soon, Archie? Want Sis to fix your tie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned then and said easily: &ldquo;Oh, I thought you were my
      brother.... How do you do, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io held out her hand to him. He hardly knew whether or not he took it
      until he felt the close, warm pressure of her fingers. Never before had he
      so poignantly realized that innate splendor of femininity that was
      uniquely hers, a quality more potent than any mere beauty. Her look met
      his straight and frankly, but he heard the breath flutter at her lips, and
      he thought to read in her eyes a question, a hunger, and a delight. His
      voice was under rigid control as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were to be here, Mrs. Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you were,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not
      Mrs. Eyre, please. I&rsquo;m Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;That was in another world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban, Ban!&rdquo; she said. Her lips seemed to cherish the name
      that they gave forth so softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly Ban. It&rsquo;s
      the same world, only older; a million years older, I think.... I came here
      only because you were coming. Are you a million years older, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfair,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never unfair. I play the game.&rdquo; Her little, firm
      chin went up defiantly. Yes: she was more lovely and vivid and desirable
      than in the other days. Or was it only the unstifled yearning in his heart
      that made her seem so? &ldquo;Have you missed me?&rdquo; she asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo; She walked over to the window and
      stood looking out into the soft and breathing murk of the night. When she
      came back to him, her manner had changed. &ldquo;Fancy finding you here of
      all places!&rdquo; she said gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t such a bad place to be,&rdquo; he said, relieved to
      meet her on the new ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goal,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Half of the aspiring
      gilded youth of the city would give their eye-teeth to make it. How did
      you manage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t manage. It was managed for me. Old Poultney Masters
      put me in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t scowl at me! For a reporter, you know, it&rsquo;s
      rather an achievement to get into The Retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Though I&rsquo;m not a reporter now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for any newspaper man. What are you, by the way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of all-round experimental editor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard of that,&rdquo; said Io, with a quickness
      which apprised him that she had been seeking information about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has. It&rsquo;s only just happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the first to know of it? That&rsquo;s as it should
      be,&rdquo; she asserted calmly. &ldquo;You shall tell me all about it at
      dinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I taking you in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: you&rsquo;re taking in my cousin, Esther Forbes. But I&rsquo;m
      on your left. Be nice to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Others came in and joined them. Banneker, his inner brain a fiery whorl,
      though the outer convolutions which he used for social purposes remained
      quite under control, drifted about making himself agreeable and approving
      himself to his host as an asset of the highest value. At dinner, sprightly
      and mischievous Miss Forbes, who recalled their former meeting at Sherry&rsquo;s,
      found him wholly delightful and frankly told him so. He talked little with
      Io; but he was conscious to his nerve-ends of the sweet warmth of her so
      near him. To her questions about his developing career he returned vague
      replies or generalizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drinking anything,&rdquo; she said, as the third
      course came on. &ldquo;Have you renounced the devil and all his works?&rdquo;
      There was an impalpable stress upon the &ldquo;all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer, composed though it was in tone, quite satisfied her. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t dare touch drink to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner there was faro bank. Banneker did not play. Io, after a run
      of indifferent luck, declared herself tired of the game and turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me out somewhere where there is air to breathe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood together on the stone terrace, blown lightly upon by a
      mist-ladden breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be a great drive of rain, filling the world,&rdquo;
      said Io in her voice of dreams. &ldquo;The roar of waters above us and
      below, and the glorious sense of being in the grip of a resistless
      current.... We&rsquo;re all in the grip of resistless currents. D&rsquo;you
      believe that yet, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skeptic! You want to work out your own fate. You &lsquo;strive to
      see, to choose your path.&rsquo; Well, you&rsquo;ve climbed. Is it
      success. Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you reached the Mountains of Fulfillment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;One never does, climbing alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been alone, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it has been for me&mdash;really. No,&rdquo; she added swiftly;
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me questions. Not now. I want to hear more of your
      new venture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He outlined his plan and hopes for The Patriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s power,
      and so it&rsquo;s danger. But it&rsquo;s good.... Are we friends, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we not be! You&rsquo;ve tried to drop me out of your life.
      Oh, I know, because I know you&mdash;better than you think. You&rsquo;ll
      never drop me out of your life again,&rdquo; she murmured with confident
      wistfulness. &ldquo;Never, Ban.... Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until she came to bid him good-night, with a lingering handclasp, her
      palm cleaving to his like the reluctant severance of lips, did she tell
      him that she was going away almost immediately. &ldquo;But I had to make
      sure first that you were really alive, and still Ban,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was many months before he saw her again.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The House With Three Eyes sent forth into the darkness a triple glow of
      hospitality. Through the aloof Chelsea district street, beyond the
      westernmost L structure, came taxicabs, hansoms, private autos, to
      discharge at the central door men who were presently revealed, under the
      lucent globe above the lintel, to be for the most part silhouette studies
      in the black of festal tailoring and silk hat against the white of
      expansive shirt-front. Occasionally, though less often, one of the doors
      at either flank of the house, also overwatched by shining orbs, opened to
      discharge an early departure. A midnight wayfarer, pausing opposite to
      contemplate this inexplicable grandeur in a dingy neighborhood, sought
      enlightenment from the passing patrolman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;? Swell gamblin&rsquo; joint? Huh?&rdquo; As
      he spoke a huge, silent car crept swiftly to the entry, which opened to
      swallow up two bareheaded, luxuriously befurred women, with their escorts.
      The curious wayfarer promptly amended his query, though not for the
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw!&rdquo; replied the policeman with scorn. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banneker? Who&rsquo;s Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With augmented contempt the officer requested the latest quotations on
      clover seed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the editor of The Patriot,&rdquo; he
      vouchsafed. &ldquo;A millionaire, too, they say. And a good sport.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Givin&rsquo; a party, huh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every Saturday night,&rdquo; answered he of the uniform and
      night-stick, who, having participated below-stairs in the reflections of
      the entertainment, was condescending enough to be informative. &ldquo;Say,
      the swellest folks in New York fall over themselves to get invited here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t he on Fi&rsquo;th Avenyah, then?&rdquo; demanded
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes the Fi&rsquo;th Avenyah bunch come to him,&rdquo;
      explained the policeman, with obvious pride. &ldquo;Took a couple of these
      old houses on long lease, knocked out the walls, built &rsquo;em into one,
      on his own plan, and, say! It&rsquo;s a pallus! I been all through it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A lithely powerful figure took the tall steps of the house three at a
      time, and turned, under the light, to toss away a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheest!&rdquo; exclaimed the wayfarer in tones of awe: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
      K.O. Doyle, the middleweight, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. If you was to get inside there
      you&rsquo;d bump into some of the biggest guys in town; a lot of high-ups
      from Wall Street, and maybe a couple of these professors from Columbyah
      College, and some swell actresses, and a bunch of high-brow writers and
      painters, and a dozen dames right off the head of the Four Hundred list.
      He takes &rsquo;em, all kinds, Mr. Banneker does, just so they&rsquo;re <i>somethin</i>&rsquo;.
      He&rsquo;s a wonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wayfarer passed on to his oniony boarding-house, a few steps along,
      deeply marveling at the irruption of magnificence into the neighborhood in
      the brief year since he had been away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equipages continued to draw up, unload, and withdraw, until twelve thirty,
      when, without so much as a preliminary wink, the House shut its Three
      Eyes. A scant five minutes earlier, an alert but tired-looking man,
      wearing the slouch hat of the West above his dinner coat, had briskly
      mounted the steps and, after colloquy with the cautious, black guardian of
      the door, had been admitted to a side room, where he was presently
      accosted by a graying, spare-set guest with ruminative eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard about this show by accident, and wanted in,&rdquo;
      explained the newcomer in response to the other&rsquo;s look of inquiry.
      &ldquo;If I could see Banneker&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be some little time before you can see him. He&rsquo;s at
      work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is his party, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The party takes care of itself until he comes down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; does it? Well, will it take care of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a friend of Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way. In fact, I might claim to have started him on his career
      of newspaper crime. I&rsquo;m Gardner of the Angelica City Herald.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban will be glad to see you. Take off your things. I am Russell
      Edmonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into a spacious and beautiful room, filled with the
      composite hum of voices and the scent of half-hidden flowers. The
      Westerner glanced avidly about him, noting here a spoken name familiar in
      print, there a face recognized from far-spread photographic reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some different from Ban&rsquo;s shack on the desert,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;Hello! Mr. Edmonds, who&rsquo;s the splendid-looking
      woman in brown with the yellow orchids, over there in the seat back of the
      palms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds leaned forward to look. &ldquo;Royce Melvin, the composer, I
      believe. I haven&rsquo;t met her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, then,&rdquo; returned the other, as the guest changed her
      position, fully revealing her face. &ldquo;Tried to dig some information
      out of her once. Like picking prickly pears blindfold. That&rsquo;s
      Camilla Van Arsdale. What a coincidence to find her here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Camilla Van Arsdale? You&rsquo;ll excuse me, won&rsquo;t you? I
      want to speak to her. Make yourself known to any one you like the looks
      of. That&rsquo;s the rule of the house; no introductions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked across the room, made his way through the crescent curving about
      Miss Van Arsdale, and, presenting himself, was warmly greeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take you to Ban,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want to
      see you at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it disturb his work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing does. He writes with an open door and a shut brain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her up the east flight of stairs and down a long hallway to an end
      room with door ajar, notwithstanding that even at that distance the hum of
      voices and the muffled throbbing of the concert grand piano from below
      were plainly audible. Banneker&rsquo;s voice, regular, mechanical,
      desensitized as the voices of those who dictate habitually are prone to
      become, floated out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quote where ignorance is bliss &lsquo;tis folly to be wise end
      quote comma said a poet who was also a cynic period. Many poets are comma
      but not the greatest period. Because of their&mdash;turn back to the
      beginning of the paragraph, please, Miss Westlake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought up an old friend, Ban,&rdquo; announced Edmonds,
      pushing wide the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely smiling, for he had trained himself to be impervious to
      interruptions, the editorializer turned in his chair. Instantly he sprang
      to his feet, and caught Miss Van Arsdale by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Camilla!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I thought you said you couldn&rsquo;t
      come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m defying the doctors,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
      given me so good a report of myself that I can afford to. I&rsquo;ll go
      down now and wait for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t. Sit up here with me till I finish. I don&rsquo;t
      want to lose any of you,&rdquo; said he affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she laughingly refused, declaring that he would be through all the
      sooner for his other guests, if she left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that she meets some people, Bop,&rdquo; Banneker directed.
      &ldquo;Gaines of The New Era, if he&rsquo;s here, and Betty Raleigh, and
      that new composer, and the Junior Masters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds nodded, and escorted her downstairs. Nicely judging the time when
      Banneker would have finished, he was back in quarter of an hour. The
      stenographer had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a superb woman, Ban!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s small
      wonder that Enderby lost himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker nodded. &ldquo;What would she have said if she could know that
      you, an absolute stranger, had been the means of saving her from a
      terrific scandal? Gives one a rather shivery feeling about the power and
      responsibility of the press, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been worse than murder,&rdquo; declared the veteran,
      with so much feeling that his friend gave him a grateful look. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      she doing in New York? Is it safe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came on to see a specialist. Yes; it&rsquo;s all right. The
      Enderbys are abroad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. How long since you&rsquo;d seen her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before this trip? Last spring, when I took a fortnight off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went clear West, just to see her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mainly. Partly, too, to get back to the restfulness of the place
      where I never had any troubles. I&rsquo;ve kept the little shack I used to
      own; pay a local chap named Mindle to keep it in shape. So I just put in a
      week of quiet there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer chap, Ban. And a loyal one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t loyal to Camilla Van Arsdale&mdash;&rdquo; said
      Banneker, and left the implication unconcluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another friend from your picturesque past is down below,&rdquo;
      said Edmonds, and named Gardner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! That fellow nearly cost me my life, last time we met,&rdquo;
      laughed Banneker. Then his face altered. Pain drew its sharp lines there,
      pain and the longing of old memories still unassuaged. &ldquo;Just the
      same, I&rsquo;ll be glad to see him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought out the Californian, found him deep in talk with Guy Mallory of
      The Ledger, who had come in late, gave him hearty greeting, and looked
      about for Camilla Van Arsdale. She was supping in the center of a
      curiously assorted group, part of whom remembered the old romance of her
      life, and part of whom had identified her, by some chance, as Royce
      Melvin, the composer. All of them were paying court to her charm and
      intelligence. She made a place beside herself for Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been discussing The Patriot, Ban,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and Mr. Gaines has embalmed you, as an editorial writer, in the
      amber of one of his best epigrams.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Gaines made a deprecating gesture. &ldquo;My little efforts
      always sound better when I&rsquo;m not present,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be the subject of any Gaines epigram, however stinging, is fame
      in itself,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no sting in this one. &lsquo;Attic salt and American pep,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      she quoted. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it truly spicy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker bowed with half-mocking appreciation. &ldquo;I fancy, though,
      that Mr. Gaines prefers his journalistic egg more <i>au naturel</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; admitted the most famous of magazine editors,
      &ldquo;I could dispense with some of the pep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the pep, too, Ban.&rdquo; Betty Raleigh, looking up from a
      seat where she sat talking to a squat and sensual-looking man, a dweller
      in the high places and cool serenities of advanced mathematics whom
      jocular-minded Nature had misdowered with the face of a satyr, interposed
      the suave candor of her voice. &ldquo;I actually lick my lips over your
      editorials even where I least agree with them. But the rest of the paper&mdash;Oh,
      dear! It screeches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modern life is such a din that one has to screech to be heard above
      it,&rdquo; said Banneker pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the newspapers which make most of the din, though?&rdquo;
      suggested the mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouting against each other,&rdquo; said Gaines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Coney Island barkers for rival shows,&rdquo; put in Junior
      Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just for variety how would it do to try the other tack and practice
      a careful but significant restraint?&rdquo; inquired Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t sell a ticket,&rdquo; declared Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if we all keep on yelling in the biggest type and hottest
      words we can find,&rdquo; pointed out Edmonds, &ldquo;the effect will
      pall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the measure of success is in finding something constantly
      more strident and startling than the other fellow&rsquo;s war whoop,&rdquo;
      surmised Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never particularly admired the steam calliope as a form of
      expression,&rdquo; observed Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the actress, smiling, &ldquo;but Royce Melvin doesn&rsquo;t
      make music for circuses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a modern newspaper is a circus,&rdquo; pronounced the
      satyr-like scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-ring variety; all the latest stunts; list to the voice of the
      ballyhoo,&rdquo; said Masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Panem et circenses</i>&rdquo; pursued the mathematician, pleased
      with his simile, &ldquo;to appease the howling rabble. But it is mostly
      circus, and very little bread that our emperors of the news give us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to feed what the animal eats,&rdquo; defended
      Banneker lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After having stimulated an artificial appetite,&rdquo; said
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the talk flowed on, Betty Raleigh adroitly drew Banneker out of the
      current of it. &ldquo;Your Patriot needn&rsquo;t have screeched at me,
      Ban,&rdquo; she murmured in an injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it, Betty? How, when, and where?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were horridly patronizing about the new piece, and
      quite unkind to me, for a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my criticism, you know,&rdquo; he reminded her
      patiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write the whole paper, though most of my
      acquaintances seem to think that I do. Any and all of it to which they
      take exception, at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I know you didn&rsquo;t write it, or it wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been so stupid. I could stand anything except the charge that I&rsquo;ve
      lost my naturalness and become conventional.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like the man who could resist anything except
      temptation, my dear: you can stand anything except criticism,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker with a smile so friendly that there was no sting in the
      words. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had enough of that. You&rsquo;re the
      spoiled pet of the critics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of this new one of yours. He&rsquo;s worse than Gurney. Who is
      he and where does he come from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An inconsiderable hamlet known as Chicago. Name, Allan Haslett.
      Dramatic criticism out there is still so unsophisticated as to be
      intelligent as well as honest&mdash;at its best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which it isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; commented the special pet of the
      theatrical reviewers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought a good new man would be better than the good old
      ones. Less hampered by personal considerations. So I sent and got this
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t good. He&rsquo;s a horrid beast. We&rsquo;ve
      been specially nice to him, on your account mostly&mdash;Ban, if you grin
      that way I shall hate you! I had Bezdek invite him to one of the rehearsal
      suppers and he wouldn&rsquo;t come. Sent word that theatrical suppers
      affected his eyesight when he came to see the play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker chuckled. &ldquo;Just why I got him. He doesn&rsquo;t let the
      personal element prejudice him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is prejudiced. And most unfair. Ban,&rdquo; said Betty in her
      most seductive tones, &ldquo;do call him down. Make him write something
      decent about us. Bez is fearfully upset.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sighed. &ldquo;The curse of this business,&rdquo; he reflected
      aloud, &ldquo;is that every one regards The Patriot as my personal toy for
      me or my friends to play with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t play at all. It&rsquo;s very much earnest. Do be
      nice about it, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, do you remember a dinner party in the first days of our
      acquaintance, at which I told you that you represented one essential
      difference from all the other women there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I thought you were terribly presuming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that you were probably the only woman present who wasn&rsquo;t
      purchasable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not understanding you as well as I do now, I was quite shocked.
      Besides, it was so unfair. Nearly all of them were most respectable
      married people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bought by their most respectable husbands. Some of &rsquo;em bought
      away from other husbands. But I gave you credit for not being on that
      market&mdash;or any other. And now you&rsquo;re trying to corrupt my
      professional virtue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is it when you try to use your influence to have me fire
      our nice, new critic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s being corruptible, I wonder if any of us are
      incorruptible.&rdquo; She stretched upward an idle hand and fondled a
      spray of freesia that drooped against her cheek. &ldquo;Ban; there&rsquo;s
      something I&rsquo;ve been waiting to tell you. Tertius Marrineal wants to
      marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suspected as much. That would settle the obnoxious
      critic, wouldn&rsquo;t it! Though it&rsquo;s rather a roundabout way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! You&rsquo;re beastly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I apologize,&rdquo; he replied quickly. &ldquo;But&mdash;have
      I got to revise my estimate of you, Betty? I should hate to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your estimate? Oh, as to purchasability. That&rsquo;s worse than
      what you&rsquo;ve just said. Yet, somehow, I don&rsquo;t resent it.
      Because it&rsquo;s honest, I suppose,&rdquo; she said pensively. &ldquo;No:
      it wouldn&rsquo;t be a&mdash;a market deal. I like Tertius. I like him a
      lot. I won&rsquo;t pretend that I&rsquo;m madly in love with him. But&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know,&rdquo; he said gently, as she paused, looking at him
      steadily, but with clouded eyes. He read into that &ldquo;but&rdquo; a
      world of opportunities; a theater of her own&mdash;the backing of a
      powerful newspaper&mdash;wealth&mdash;and all, if she so willed it,
      without interruption to her professional career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you think any the less of me?&rdquo; she asked wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you think any the less of yourself?&rdquo; he countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blossoming spray broke under her hand. &ldquo;Ah, yes; that&rsquo;s
      the question after all, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Gardner, the eternal journalist, fostering a plan of his own,
      was gathering material from Guy Mallory who had come in late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What gets me,&rdquo; he said, looking over at the host, &ldquo;is
      how he can do a day&rsquo;s work with all this social powwow going on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day&rsquo;s? He does three days&rsquo; work in every one. He&rsquo;s
      the hardest trained mind in the business. Why, he could sit down here this
      minute, in the middle of this room, and dictate an editorial while keeping
      up his end in the general talk. I&rsquo;ve seen him do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a wonder at concentration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Concentration? If he didn&rsquo;t invent it, he perfected it. Tell
      you a story. Ban doesn&rsquo;t go in for any game except polo. One day
      some of the fellows at The Retreat got talking golf to him&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Retreat? Good Lord! He doesn&rsquo;t belong to The Retreat,
      does he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; been a member for years. Well, they got him to agree to try
      it. Jim Tamson, the pro&mdash;he&rsquo;s supposed to be the best
      instructor in America&mdash;was there then. Banneker went out to the first
      tee, a 215-yard hole, watched Jim perform his show-em-how swing, asked a
      couple of questions. &lsquo;Eye on the ball,&rsquo; says Jim. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      nine tenths of it. The rest is hitting it easy and following through.
      Simple and easy,&rsquo; says Jim, winking to himself. Banneker tries two
      or three clubs to see which feels easiest to handle, picks out a
      driving-iron, and slams the ball almost to the edge of the green. Chance?
      Of course, there was some luck in it. But it was mostly his everlasting
      ability to keep his attention focused. Jim almost collapsed. &lsquo;First
      time I ever saw a beginner that didn&rsquo;t top,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
      make a golfer, Mr. Banneker.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not me,&rsquo; says Ban. &lsquo;This game is too easy. It
      doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rsquo; He hands Jim a twenty-dollar bill,
      thanks him, goes in and has his bath, and has never touched a golf-stick
      since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner had been listening with a kindling eye. He brought his fist down
      on his knee. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me something!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to try it out on your own game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not about golf. About Banneker. I&rsquo;ve been wondering how he
      managed to establish himself as an individual figure in this big town. Now
      I begin to see it. It&rsquo;s publicity; that&rsquo;s what it is. He&rsquo;s
      got the sense of how to make himself talked about. He&rsquo;s picturesque.
      I&rsquo;ll bet Banneker&rsquo;s first and last golf shot is a legend in
      the clubs yet, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; confirmed Mallory. &ldquo;But do you really
      think that he reasoned it all out on the spur of the moment?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, reasoned; probably not. It&rsquo;s instinctive, I tell you. And
      the twenty to the professional was a touch of genius. Tamson will never
      stop talking about it. Can&rsquo;t you hear him, telling it to his fellow
      pros? Golf&rsquo;s too easy for me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;and hands me a
      double sawbuck! Did ye ever hear the like!&rsquo; And so the legend is
      built up. It&rsquo;s a great thing to become a local legend. I know, for I&rsquo;ve
      built up a few of &rsquo;em myself.... I suppose the gun-play on the
      river-front gave him his start at it and the rest came easy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him. He&rsquo;ll probably tell you,&rdquo; said Mallory.
      &ldquo;At least, he&rsquo;ll be interested in your theory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardner strolled over to Banneker&rsquo;s group, not for the purpose of
      adopting Mallory&rsquo;s suggestion, for he was well satisfied with his
      own diagnosis, but to congratulate him upon the rising strength of The
      Patriot. As he approached, Miss Van Arsdale, in response to a plea from
      Betty Raleigh, went to the piano, and the dwindled crowd settled down into
      silence. For music, at The House With Three Eyes, was invariably the sort
      of music that people listen to; that is, the kind of people whom Banneker
      gathered around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had played, Miss Van Arsdale declared that she must go,
      whereupon Banneker insisted upon taking her to her hotel. To her protests
      against dragging him away from his own party, he retorted that the party
      could very well run itself without him; his parties often did, when he was
      specially pressed in his work. Accepting this, his friend elected to walk;
      she wanted to hear more about The Patriot. What did she think of it, he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to like it,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I do tremendously admire your
      editorials. They&rsquo;re beautifully done; the perfection of clarity. But
      the rest of the paper&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see you in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not there, as an individual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He expounded to her his theory of journalism. That was a just
      characterization of Junior Masters, he said: the three-ringed circus. He,
      Banneker, would run any kind of a circus they wanted, to catch and hold
      their eyes; the sensational acts, the clowns of the funny pages, the blare
      of the bands, the motion, the color, and the spangles; all to beguile them
      into reading and eventually to thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t worked it out yet, as we should. What I&rsquo;m
      really aiming at is a saturated solution, as the chemists say: Not a
      saturated solution of circulation, for that isn&rsquo;t possible, but a
      saturated solution of influence. If we can&rsquo;t put The Patriot into
      every man&rsquo;s house, we ought to be able to put it into every man&rsquo;s
      mind. All things to all men: that&rsquo;s the formula. We&rsquo;re far
      from it yet, but we&rsquo;re on the road. And in the editorials, I&rsquo;m
      making people stir their minds about real things who never before
      developed a thought beyond the everyday, mechanical processes of living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what end?&rdquo; she asked doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it matter? Isn&rsquo;t the thinking, in itself, end enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brutish thinking if it&rsquo;s represented in your screaming
      headlines.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Predigested news. I want to preserve all their brain-power for my
      editorial page. And, oh, how easy I make it for them! Thoughts of one
      syllable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you use your power over their minds to incite them to
      discontent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s dreadful, Ban! To stir up bitterness and rancor
      among people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be misled by cant, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; adjured
      Banneker. &ldquo;The contented who have everything to make them content
      have put a stigma on discontent. They&rsquo;d have us think it a crime. It
      isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a virtue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! A virtue?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; isn&rsquo;t it? Call it by the other name, ambition. What
      then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale pondered with troubled eyes. &ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo;
      she confessed. &ldquo;But the discontent that arises within one&rsquo;s
      self is one thing; the &lsquo;divine discontent.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s quite
      another to foment it for your own purposes in the souls of others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon the purpose. If the purpose is to help the
      others, through making their discontent effective to something better, isn&rsquo;t
      it justified?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there always the danger of making a profession of
      discontent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shrewd hit,&rdquo; confessed Banneker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      suspected that Marrineal means to capitalize it eventually, though I don&rsquo;t
      know just how. He&rsquo;s a secret sort of animal, Marrineal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he gives you a free hand?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has to,&rdquo; said Banneker simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s success, Ban. Isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s success. In its kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it happiness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Also in its kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real kind? The best kind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s satisfaction. I&rsquo;m doing what I want to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped for something more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t have everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she demanded almost fiercely. &ldquo;You ought to
      have. You&rsquo;re made for it.&rdquo; After a pause she added: &ldquo;Then
      it isn&rsquo;t Betty Raleigh. I&rsquo;d hoped it was. I&rsquo;ve been
      watching her. There&rsquo;s character there, Ban, as well as charm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has other interests. No; it isn&rsquo;t Betty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, there are times when I could hate her,&rdquo; broke out Miss
      Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Betty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know whom well enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand corrected in grammar as well as fact,&rdquo; he said
      lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I see her occasionally. Not often.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she come here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, aren&rsquo;t you ever going to get over it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you won&rsquo;t. There are a few of us like that. God help us!&rdquo;
      said Camilla Van Arsdale.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Others than Banneker&rsquo;s friends and frequenters now evinced symptoms
      of interest in his influence upon his environment. Approve him you might,
      or disapprove him; the palpable fact remained that he wielded a growing
      power. Several promising enterprises directed at the City Treasury had
      aborted under destructive pressure from his pen. A once impregnably
      cohesive ring of Albany legislators had disintegrated with such violence
      of mutual recrimination that prosecution loomed imminent, because of a two
      weeks&rsquo; &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; of Banneker&rsquo;s at the State
      Capitol. He had hunted some of the lawlessness out of the Police
      Department and bludgeoned some decent housing measures through the city
      councils. Politically he was deemed faithless and unreliable which meant
      that, as an independent, he had ruined some hopefully profitable
      combinations in both parties. Certain men, high up in politics and finance
      at the point where they overlap, took thoughtful heed of him. How could
      they make him useful? Or, at least, prevent him from being harmful?
    </p>
    <p>
      No less a potentate than Poultney Masters had sought illumination from
      Willis Enderby upon the subject in the days when people in street-cars
      first began to rustle through the sheets of The Patriot, curious to see
      what the editorial had to say to them that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo; began the magnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Able,&rdquo; grunted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he weren&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t be troubling my head about
      him. What else? Dangerous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As dangerous as he is upright. Exactly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I wonder what the devil you mean by that, Enderby,&rdquo; said
      the financier testily. &ldquo;Dangerous as long as he&rsquo;s upright? Eh?
      And dangerous to what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To anything he goes after. He&rsquo;s got a following. I might
      almost say a blind following.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a boss, too, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrineal? Ah, I don&rsquo;t know how far Marrineal interferes. And
      I don&rsquo;t know Marrineal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upright, too; that one?&rdquo; The sneer in Masters&rsquo;s heavy
      voice was palpable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider that no newspaper can be upright,&rdquo; the lawyer
      interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought &rsquo;em and bluffed &rsquo;em and stood &rsquo;em
      in a corner to be good,&rdquo; returned the other simply. &ldquo;What
      would you expect my opinion to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sphere, among them?&rdquo; queried the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn The Sphere!&rdquo; exploded the other. &ldquo;A dirty,
      muck-grubbing, lying, crooked rag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your actual grudge against it is not for those latter qualities,
      though,&rdquo; pointed out Enderby. &ldquo;On questions where it conflicts
      with your enterprises, it&rsquo;s straight enough. That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s
      defect. Upright equals dangerous. You perceive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Masters shrugged the problem away with a thick and ponderous jerk of his
      shoulders. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s young Banneker after?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know him as well as I. He&rsquo;s a sort of protégé of
      yours, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At The Retreat, you mean? I put him in because he looked to be polo
      stuff. Now the young squirt won&rsquo;t practice enough to be certain team
      material.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found a bigger game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! But what&rsquo;s in back of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the game for the game&rsquo;s sake with him, I suspect.
      I can only tell you that, wherever I&rsquo;ve had contact with him, he has
      been perfectly straightforward.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. But what about this anarchistic stuff of his?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anarchistic! You mean his attacks on Wall Street? The Stock
      Exchange isn&rsquo;t synonymous with the Constitution of the United
      States, you know, Masters. Do moderate your language.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re laughing at me, damn you, Enderby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for you. You ought to laugh at yourself more. Ask
      Banneker what he&rsquo;s at. Very probably he&rsquo;ll laugh at you
      inside. But he&rsquo;ll answer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me. He had an editorial last week that stuck to me.
      It is the bitter laughter of the people that shakes thrones. Have a care,
      you money kings, not to become too ridiculous!&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that
      socialist-anarchist stuff?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very young stuff. But it&rsquo;s got a quality, hasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell, yes; quality!&rdquo; rumbled the profane old man. &ldquo;Well,
      I will tackle your young prodigy one of these days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, accordingly, he did, encountering, some days later, Banneker in the
      reading-room at The Retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you up to; making trouble with that editorial screed of
      yours?&rdquo; he growled at the younger man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker smiled. He accepted that growl from Poultney Masters, not because
      Masters was a great and formidable figure in the big world, but because
      beneath the snarl there was a quality of&mdash;no, not of friendliness,
      but of man-to-man approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m trying to cure trouble, not make it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! Queer idea of curing. Here we are in the midst of good times,
      everywhere, and you talk about&mdash;what was the stuff?&mdash;oh, yes:
      &lsquo;The grinning mask of prosperity, beneath which Want searches with
      haggard and threatening eyes for the crust denied.&rsquo; Fine stuff!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine. I don&rsquo;t write as beautifully as all that. It&rsquo;s
      quoted from a letter. But I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility, since I
      quoted it. There&rsquo;s some truth in it, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a hair&rsquo;s-weight. If you fill the minds of the ignorant
      with that sort of thing, where shall we end?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fill the minds of the ignorant, they will no longer be
      ignorant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll be above their class and their work. Our whole
      trouble is in that; people thinking they&rsquo;re too good for the sort of
      work they&rsquo;re fitted for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they too good if they can think themselves into
      something better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poultney Masters delivered himself of a historical profundity. &ldquo;The
      man who first had the notion of teaching the mass of people to read will
      have something to answer for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Destructive, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Banneker, looking up
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you want to go farther. You want to teach &rsquo;em to think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Why, because, you young idiot, they&rsquo;ll think wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. At first. We all had to spell wrong before we spelled
      right. What if people do think wrong? It&rsquo;s the thinking that&rsquo;s
      important. Eventually they&rsquo;ll think right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the newspapers to guide them?&rdquo; There was a world of
      scorn in the magnate&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some will guide wrong. Some will guide right. The most I hope to do
      is to teach &rsquo;em a little to use their minds. Education and a fair
      field. To find out and to make clear what is found; that&rsquo;s the
      business of a newspaper as I see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tittle-tattle. Tale-mongering,&rdquo; was Masters&rsquo;s
      contemptuous qualification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A royal mission,&rdquo; laughed Banneker. &ldquo;I call the Sage to
      witness. &lsquo;But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got to be kings,&rdquo; retorted the other
      quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tricky business, Banneker. Better go in for
      polo. We need you.&rdquo; He lumbered away, morose and growling, but
      turned back to call over his shoulder: &ldquo;Read your own stuff when you
      get up to-morrow and see if polo isn&rsquo;t a better game and a cleaner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What the Great of the city might think of his journalistic achievement
      troubled Banneker but little, so long as they thought of it at all,
      thereby proving its influence; the general public was his sole arbiter,
      except for the opinions of the very few whose approval he really desired,
      Io Eyre, Camilla Van Arsdale, and more remotely the men for whose own
      standards he maintained a real respect, such as Willis Enderby and Gaines.
      Determined to make Miss Van Arsdale see his point of view, as well as to
      assure himself of hers, he had extracted from her a promise that she would
      visit The Patriot office before she returned to the West. Accordingly, on
      a set morning she arrived on her trip of inspection, tall, serene, and, in
      her aloof <i>genre</i>, beautiful, an alien figure in the midst of that
      fevered and delirious energy. He took her through the plant, elucidating
      the mechanical processes of the daily miracle of publication, more
      far-reaching than was ever any other voice of man, more ephemeral than the
      day of the briefest butterfly. Throughout, the visitor&rsquo;s pensive
      eyes kept turning from the creature to the creator, until, back in the
      trim quietude of his office, famed as the only orderly working-room of
      journalism, she delivered her wondering question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> have made all this, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ve remade it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;No; as I told you before, I can&rsquo;t see you
      in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, it doesn&rsquo;t express me. It isn&rsquo;t meant to.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom does it express, then? Mr. Marrineal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t an expression at all in that sense. It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a
      response. A response to the demand of hundreds of thousands of people who
      have never had a newspaper made for them before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An echo of <i>vox populi</i>? Does that excuse its sins?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not putting it forth as an excuse. Is it really sins or
      only bad taste that offends you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever, Ban. And true in a measure. But insincerity is more than
      bad taste. It&rsquo;s one of the primal sins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find The Patriot insincere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I find it anything else, knowing you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you go wrong again, Miss Camilla. As an expression of my
      ideals, the news part of the paper would be insincere. I don&rsquo;t like
      it much better than you do. But I endure it; yes, I&rsquo;ll be frank and
      admit that I even encourage it, because it gives me wider scope for the
      things I want to say. Sincere things. I&rsquo;ve never yet written in my
      editorial column anything that I don&rsquo;t believe from the bottom of my
      soul. Take that as a basis on which to judge me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ban! I don&rsquo;t want to judge you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to,&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;I want your judgment
      and your criticism. But you must see what I&rsquo;m aiming for. Miss
      Camilla, I&rsquo;m making people stir their minds and think who never
      before had a thought beyond the everyday processes of life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own purposes? Thought, as you manipulate it, might be a
      high-explosive. Have you thought of using it in that way?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I found a part of the social edifice that had to be blown to
      pieces, I might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care that you don&rsquo;t involve us all in the crash.
      Meantime, what is the rest of your editorial page; a species of sedative
      to lull their minds? Who is Evadne Ellington?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of our most prominent young murderesses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you let her sign a column on your page?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a highly moral murderess. Killed her lover in
      defense of her honor, you know. Which means that she shot him when he got
      tired of her. A sobbing jury promptly acquitted her, and now she&rsquo;s
      writing &lsquo;Warnings to Young Girls.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re most
      improving and affecting, I assure you. We look after that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban! I hate to have you so cynical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Ask the Prevention of Vice
      people and the criminologists. They&rsquo;ll tell you that Evadne&rsquo;s
      column is a real influence for good among the people who read and believe
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What class is Reformed Rennigan&rsquo;s sermon aimed at?&rdquo; she
      inquired, with wrinkling nostrils. &ldquo;&lsquo;Soaking it to Satan&rsquo;;
      is that another regular feature?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice a week. It gives us a Y.M.C.A. circulation that is worth a
      good deal to us. Outside of my double column, the page is a sort of forum.
      I&rsquo;ll take anything that is interesting or authoritative. For
      example, if Royce Melvin had something of value to say to the public about
      music, where else could she find so wide a hearing as through The Patriot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; returned his visitor dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Are you sure? What is your opinion of &lsquo;The Star-Spangled
      Banner&rsquo; as a national song?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For every reason. The music misfits the words. It&rsquo;s beyond
      the range of most voices. The harmonies are thin. No crowd in the world
      can sing it. What is the value or inspiration of a national song that the
      people can&rsquo;t sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask it of The Patriot&rsquo;s public. I&rsquo;ll follow it up
      editorially; &lsquo;Wanted; A Song for America.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she answered impulsively. Then she laughed. &ldquo;Is
      that the way you get your contributors?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often, as the spider said to the fly,&rdquo; grinned Banneker the
      shameless. &ldquo;Take a thousand words or more and let us have your
      picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not that. I&rsquo;ve seen my friends&rsquo; pictures too often
      in your society columns. By the way, how comes it that a paper devoted to
      the interests of the common people maintains that aristocratic feature?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the common people eat it alive. Russell Edmonds is largely
      responsible for keeping it up. You should hear his theory. It&rsquo;s
      ingenious. I&rsquo;ll send for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds, who chanced to be at his desk, entered the editorial den with his
      tiny pipe between his teeth, and, much disconcerted at finding a lady
      there, hastily removed it until Miss Van Arsdale suggested its
      restitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? The society page?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes; I was against
      dropping it. You see, Miss Van Arsdale, I&rsquo;m a Socialist in belief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a pun concealed in that or are you serious, Mr. Edmonds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious. I&rsquo;m always that on the subjects of Socialism and The
      Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must explain if I&rsquo;m to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom is society news read? By two classes,&rdquo; expounded the
      veteran; &ldquo;those whose names appear, and those who are envious of
      those whose names appear. Well, we&rsquo;re after the envious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t see. With what purpose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Simpson, who has just got his grocery bill for more than he can
      pay, reads a high-colored account of Mrs. Stumpley-Triggs&rsquo;s aquatic
      dinner served in the hundred-thousand-dollar swimming-pool on her
      Westchester estate. That makes Jim think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that it makes him discontented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, discontent is a mighty leaven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Arsdale directed her fine and serious eyes upon Banneker. &ldquo;So
      it comes back to the cult of discontent. Is that Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s
      formula, too, Mr. Edmonds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Underneath all his appearance of candor, Marrineal&rsquo;s a secret
      animal,&rdquo; said Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he leave you a free hand with your editorials, Ban?&rdquo;
      inquired the outsider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watches the circulation only,&rdquo; said Edmonds. &ldquo;Thus far,&rdquo;
      he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking for an ulterior motive, then,&rdquo;
      interpreted Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for whatever I can find in Marrineal, Miss Van
      Arsdale,&rdquo; confessed the patriarch of the office. &ldquo;As yet I
      haven&rsquo;t found much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered his
      theory of journalism. We three, Edmonds, Marrineal, and I, regard this
      business from three diverse viewpoints. To Edmonds it&rsquo;s a vocation
      and a rostrum. He wants really, under his guise as the most far-seeing
      news man of his time, to call sinners against society to repentance, or to
      force repentance down their throats. There&rsquo;s a good deal of the
      stern evangelist about you, you know, Pop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; The other&rsquo;s smile seemed enmeshed in the
      dainty spiral of smoke brooding above his pursed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m more the pedagogue. With me, too, the game is a
      vocation. But it&rsquo;s a different one. I&rsquo;d like to marshal men&rsquo;s
      minds as a generalissimo marshals armies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the bonds of your own discipline?&rdquo; asked Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could chain a mind I&rsquo;d be the most splendid tyrant of
      history. No. Free leadership of the free is good enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Marrineal will leave you free,&rdquo; commented the veteran.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your diagnosis of Marrineal, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A priest of Baal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With The Patriot in the part of Baal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not precisely The Patriot. Publicity, rather, of which The Patriot
      is merely the instrument. Marrineal&rsquo;s theory of publicity is
      interesting. It may even be true. Substantially it is this: All civilized
      Americans fear and love print; that is to say, Publicity, for which read
      Baal. They fear it for what it may do to them. They love and fawn on it
      for what it may do for them. It confers the boon of glory and launches the
      bolts of shame. Its favorites, made and anointed from day to day, are the
      blessed of their time. Those doomed by it are the outcasts. It sits in
      momentary judgment, and appeal from its decisions is too late to avail
      anything to its victims. A species of auto-juggernaut, with Marrineal at
      the wheel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rubbish!&rdquo; said Miss Van Arsdale with amused scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because you&rsquo;ve nothing to ask or fear from Baal. Yet even
      you would use it, for your musical preachment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he became aware of Edmonds staring moodily and with pinched
      lips at Miss Van Arsdale. To the mind&rsquo;s eye of the old stager had
      flashed a sudden and astounding vision of all that pride of womanhood and
      purity underlying the beauty of the face, overlaid and fouled by the inky
      vomit of Baal of the printing-press, as would have come to pass had not
      he, Edmonds, obstructed the vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine nothing printed,&rdquo; said the woman who had loved
      Willis Enderby, &ldquo;that could in any manner influence my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunate you!&rdquo; Edmonds wreathed his little congratulation in
      festoons of light vapor. &ldquo;But you live in a world of your own
      making. Marrineal is reckoning on the world which lives and thinks largely
      in terms of what its neighbor thinks of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He once said to me,&rdquo; remarked Banneker, &ldquo;that the
      desire to get into or keep out of print could be made the master-key to
      new and undreamed-of powers of journalism if one had the ability to find a
      formula for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I understand what he means,&rdquo; said
      Miss Van Arsdale, &ldquo;but it has a sinister sound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are Baal&rsquo;s other names Bribery and Blackmail?&rdquo; glowered
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has never been a hint of any illegitimate use of the paper,
      so far as I can discover. Yet it&rsquo;s pretty plain to me that he
      intends to use it as an instrument.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as we&rsquo;ve made it strong enough,&rdquo; supplied
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An instrument of what?&rdquo; inquired Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Power for himself. Political, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he want office?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Perhaps he prefers the deeper-lying power to make and
      unmake politicians. We&rsquo;ve done it already in a few cases. That&rsquo;s
      Edmonds&rsquo;s specialty. I&rsquo;ll know within a few days what
      Marrineal wants, if I can get a showdown. He and I are coming to a new
      basis of finance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he thinks he can&rsquo;t afford to keep on paying you by
      circulation. You&rsquo;re putting on too much.&rdquo; This from Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he got me here for. However, I don&rsquo;t really
      believe he can. I&rsquo;m eating up what should be the paper&rsquo;s
      legitimate profits. And yet&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled radiantly&mdash;&ldquo;there
      are times when I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to get along with
      what I have. It&rsquo;s pretty absurd, isn&rsquo;t it, to feel pinched on
      fifty thousand a year, when I did so well at Manzanita on sixty a month?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fairy-tale,&rdquo; declared Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;I
      knew that you were going to arrive sooner or later, Ban. But this isn&rsquo;t
      an arrival. It&rsquo;s a triumph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather it&rsquo;s a feat of balancing,&rdquo; he propounded.
      &ldquo;A tight-rope stunt on a gilded rope. Failure on one side; debt on
      the other. Keep going like the devil to save yourself from falling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it making of him, Mr. Edmonds?&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s
      oldest friend turned her limpid and anxious regard upon his closest
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A power. Oh, it&rsquo;s real enough, all this empire of words that
      crumbles daily. It leaves something behind, a little residue of thought,
      ideals, convictions. What do you fear for him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynicism,&rdquo; she breathed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the curse of the game. But it doesn&rsquo;t get the
      worker who feels his work striking home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see any trace of cynicism in the paper?&rdquo; asked
      Banneker curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this blaring and glaring and froth and distortion,&rdquo; she
      replied, sweeping her hand across the issue which lay on the desk before
      her. &ldquo;Can you do that sort of thing and not become that sort of
      thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Edmonds,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty years I&rsquo;ve been in this business,&rdquo; said the
      veteran slowly. &ldquo;I suppose there are few of its problems and
      perplexities that I haven&rsquo;t been up against. And I tell you, Miss
      Van Arsdale, all this froth and noise and sensationalism doesn&rsquo;t
      matter. It&rsquo;s an offense to taste, I know. But back of it is the big
      thing that we&rsquo;re trying to do; to enlist the ignorant and helpless
      and teach them to be less ignorant and helpless. If fostering the
      political ambitions of a Marrineal is part of the price, why, I&rsquo;m
      willing to pay it, so long as the paper keeps straight and doesn&rsquo;t
      sell itself for bribe money. After all, Marrineal can ride to his goal
      only on our chariot. The Patriot is an institution now. You can&rsquo;t
      alter an institution, not essentially. You get committed to it, to the
      thing you&rsquo;ve made yourself. Ban and I have made the new Patriot, not
      Marrineal. Even if he got rid of us, he couldn&rsquo;t change the paper;
      not for a long time and only very gradually. The following that we&rsquo;ve
      built up would be too strong for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too strong for you two?&rdquo; asked the doubting
      woman-soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We understand it because we made it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankenstein once said something like that,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a monster,&rdquo; rumbled Edmonds. &ldquo;Sometimes
      I think it&rsquo;s a toy dog, with Ban&rsquo;s ribbon around its cute
      little neck. I&rsquo;ll answer for Ban, Miss Van Arsdale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke of his minute pipe went up, tenuous and graceful, incense
      devoted to the unseen God behind the strangely patterned curtain of print;
      to Baal who was perhaps even then grinning down upon his unsuspecting
      worshipers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Banneker, moving purposefully amidst that vast phantasmagoria of
      pulsing print, wherein all was magnified, distorted, perverted to the
      claims of a gross and rabid public appetite, dreamed his pure, untainted
      dream; the conception of his newspaper as a voice potent enough to reach
      and move all; dominant enough to impose its underlying ideal; confident
      enough of righteousness to be free of all silencing and control. That
      voice should supply the long unsatisfied hunger of the many for truth
      uncorrupted. It should enunciate straightly, simply, without reservation,
      the daily verities destined to build up the eternal structure. It should
      be a religion of seven days a week, set forth by a thousand devoted
      preachers for a million faithful hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale had partly read his dream, and could have wept for it
      and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io Eyre had begun to read it, and her heart went out to him anew. For this
      was the test of success.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was one of those mornings of coolness after cloying heat when even the
      crowded, reeking, frowzy metropolis wakes with a breath of freshness in
      its nostrils. Independent of sleep as ever, Banneker was up and footing it
      briskly for the station before eight o&rsquo;clock, for Camilla Van
      Arsdale was returning to Manzanita, having been ordered back to her
      seclusion with medical science&rsquo;s well-considered verdict wrapped up
      in tactful words to bear her company on the long journey. When she would
      be ordered on a longer journey by a mightier Authority, medical science
      forbore to specify; but in the higher interests of American music it was
      urgently pressed upon her that she be abstemious in diet, niggardly of
      work, careful about fatigue and excitement, and in general comport herself
      in such manner as to deprive the lease of life remaining to her of most of
      its savor and worth. She had told Ban that the physicians thought her
      condition favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invalidism was certainly not suggested in her erect bearing and serene
      face as she moved about her stateroom setting in order the books,
      magazines, flowers, and candy, with which Banneker had sought to fortify
      her against the tedium of the trip. As the time for departure drew near,
      they fell into and effortfully maintained that meaningless, banal, and
      jerky talk which is the inevitable concomitant of long partings between
      people who, really caring for each other, can find nothing but
      commonplaces wherewith to ease their stress of mind. Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s
      common sense came to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, my dear,&rdquo; she said, with her understanding smile.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re obliged to cling to the
      dragging minutes. It&rsquo;s an ungraceful posture.... Ban! What makes you
      look like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I heard&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear voice outside said, &ldquo;Then it must be this one.&rdquo; There
      was a decisive tap on the door. &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;..."Come in,&rdquo;
      responded Miss Van Arsdale. &ldquo;Bring them here, porter,&rdquo;
      directed the voice outside, and Io entered followed by an attendant almost
      hidden in a huge armful of such roses as are unpurchasable even in the
      most luxurious of stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looted our conservatory,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Papa
      will slay me. They&rsquo;ll last to Chicago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After an almost imperceptible hesitation she kissed the older woman. She
      gave her hand to Banneker. &ldquo;I knew I should find you here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other woman of my acquaintance would have said, &lsquo;Who
      would have expected to find you here!&rsquo;&rdquo; commented Miss Van
      Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? I suppose so. But we&rsquo;ve never been on that footing, Ban
      and I.&rdquo; Io&rsquo;s tone was casual; almost careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you were in the country,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we are. I drove up this morning to bid Miss Van Arsdale <i>bon
      voyage</i>, and all the luck in the world. I suppose we three shall meet
      again one of these days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prophesy in the most matter-of-fact tone a gross improbability,&rdquo;
      observed Miss Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, our first meeting was the gross improbability,&rdquo; retorted
      the girl lightly. &ldquo;After that anything might be logical. <i>Au
      revoir</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with her, Ban,&rdquo; said Miss Camilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t leaving time yet,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      five whole minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; come with me, Ban,&rdquo; said Io tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale kissed his cheek, gave him a little, half-motherly
      pat, said, &ldquo;Keep on making me proud of you,&rdquo; in her even,
      confident tones, and pushed him out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ban and Io walked down the long platform in a thoughtful silence which
      disconcerted neither of them. Io led the way out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At half-past four,&rdquo; she stated, &ldquo;I had a glass of milk
      and one cracker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you want to breakfast?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanking you humbly, sir, for your kind invitation, the nearer the
      better. Why not here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a table in the well-appointed railroad restaurant and ordered.
      Over her honey-dew melon Io asked musingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose she thinks of us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Camilla? What should she think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed? What do we think, ourselves?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it any importance?&rdquo; he asked gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s rather rude,&rdquo; she chided. &ldquo;Anything
      that I think should, by courtesy, be regarded as important.... Ban, how
      often have we seen each other?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I came to New York, you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many? And how much have we talked together? All told; in time, I
      mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly a solid hour. Not more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t made any difference, has it? There&rsquo;s been no
      interruption. We&rsquo;ve never let the thread drop. We&rsquo;ve never
      lost touch. Not really.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We&rsquo;ve never lost touch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t repeat it as if it were a matter for mourning and
      repentance. I think it rather wonderful.... Take our return from the
      train, all the way down without a word. Were you sulking, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You know I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know it. It was simply that we didn&rsquo;t need to
      talk. There&rsquo;s no one else in the world like that.... How long is it?
      Three years&mdash;four&mdash;more than four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      We twain once well in sunder What will the mad gods do For hate with me,
      I wond&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Io! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban; I&rsquo;m sorry! Have I hurt you? I was dreaming back into
      the old world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been trying all these years not to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the reality really better? No; don&rsquo;t answer that! I don&rsquo;t
      want you to. Answer me something else. About Betty Raleigh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a man I should find her an irresistible sort of person.
      Entirely aside from her art. Are you going to marry her, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me why not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one reason because she doesn&rsquo;t want to marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you asked her? It&rsquo;s none of my business. But I don&rsquo;t
      believe you have. Tell me this; would you have asked her, if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for&mdash;if Number Three had never been wrecked in the cut? You see
      the old railroad terms you taught me still cling. Would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? If the world hadn&rsquo;t changed under my feet, and
      the sky over my head&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so changed? Do the big things, the real things, ever
      change?... Don&rsquo;t answer that, either. Ban, if I&rsquo;ll go out of
      your life now, and stay out, <i>honestly</i>, will you marry Betty Raleigh
      and&mdash;and live happy ever after?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you want me to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Truly. And I&rsquo;d hate you both forever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty Raleigh is going to marry some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I thought&mdash;people said&mdash;Are you sorry, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for myself. I think he&rsquo;s the wrong man for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that would be a change of the earth underfoot and the sky
      overhead, if one cared,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;And I said they didn&rsquo;t
      change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; retorted Banneker bitterly. &ldquo;You are
      married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been married,&rdquo; she corrected, with an air of amiable
      rectification. &ldquo;It was a wise thing to do. Everybody said so. It
      didn&rsquo;t last. Nobody thought it would. I didn&rsquo;t really think so
      myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why in Heaven&rsquo;s name&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s not talk about it now. Some other time, perhaps.
      Say next time we meet; five or six months from now.... No; I won&rsquo;t
      tease you any more, Ban. It won&rsquo;t be that. It won&rsquo;t be long. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you the truth: I&rsquo;d heard a lot about you and Betty Raleigh, and
      I got to know her and I hoped it would be a go. I did; truly, Ban. I owed
      you that chance of happiness. I took mine, you see; only it wasn&rsquo;t
      happiness that I gambled for. Something else. Safety. The stakes are
      usually different for men and women. So now you know.... Well, if you don&rsquo;t,
      you&rsquo;ve grown stupid. And I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it any
      more. I want to talk about&mdash;about The Patriot. I read it this morning
      while I was waiting; your editorial. Ban&rdquo;&mdash;she drew a derisive
      mouth&mdash;&ldquo;I was shocked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it? Politics?&rdquo; asked Banneker, who, turning out his
      editorials several at a time, seldom bothered to recall on what particular
      day any one was published. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to like
      our politics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not politics. It is about Harvey Wheelwright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was amused. &ldquo;The immortally popular Wheelwright. We&rsquo;re
      serializing his new novel, &lsquo;Satiated with Sin,&rsquo; in the Sunday
      edition. My idea. It&rsquo;ll put on circulation where we most need it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that any reason why you should exploit him as if he were the
      foremost living novelist?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Besides, he is, in popularity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Ban; his stuff is awful! If this latest thing is like the
      earlier. [&ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; murmured Banneker.] And you&rsquo;re
      writing about him as if he were&mdash;well, Conrad and Wells rolled into
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s better than that, for the kind of people that read him.
      It&rsquo;s addressed to them, that editorial. All the stress is on his
      piety, his popularity, his power to move men&rsquo;s minds; there isn&rsquo;t
      a word that even touches on the domain of art or literary skill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has that effect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That&rsquo;s my art,&rdquo; chuckled Banneker. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i>
      literary skill, if you choose!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I call it? I call it treason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind flashed to meet hers. She read comprehension in his changed face
      and the shadow in her eyes, lambent and profound, deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treason to the world that we two made for ourselves out there,&rdquo;
      she pursued evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shattered it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Undying Voices.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stilled them, for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban! Not that!&rdquo; A sudden, little sob wrenched at her
      throat. She half thrust out a hand toward him, and withdrew it, to cup and
      hold her chin in the old, thoughtful posture that plucked at his heart
      with imperious memories. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they sing for you any more?&rdquo;
      begged Io, wistful as a child forlorn for a dream of fairies dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let them. They all sang of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, but about the tender corners of her lips crept the tremor of a
      smile. Instantly she became serious again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you still heard the Voices, you could never have written that
      editorial.... What I hate about it is that it has charm; that it imparts
      charm to a&mdash;to a debasing thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Io!&rdquo; protested the victim of this criticism, more
      easily. &ldquo;Debasing? Why, Wheelwright is considered the most uplifting
      of all our literary morality-improvers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io amplified and concluded her critique briefly and viciously. &ldquo;A
      slug!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; seriously. I&rsquo;m not sure that he doesn&rsquo;t inculcate a
      lot of good in his way. At least he&rsquo;s always on the side of the
      angels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of angels? Tinsel seraphs with paint on their cheeks,
      playing rag-time harps out of tune! There&rsquo;s a sickly slaver of
      sentiment over everything he touches that would make any virtue nauseous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want a job as a literary critic Our Special
      Reviewer, Miss Io Wel&mdash;Mrs. Delavan Eyre,&rdquo; he concluded, in a
      tone from which the raillery had flattened out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that bald betrayal, Io&rsquo;s color waned slightly. She lifted her
      water-glass and sipped at it. When she spoke again it was as if an inner
      scene had been shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come to New York for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As in all the fables. And you&rsquo;ve found it. It was almost too
      easy, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, not. It was touch and go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have come but for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, considering, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she adjured him; &ldquo;success was my
      prescription. Be flattering for once. Let me think that I&rsquo;m
      responsible for the miracle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I couldn&rsquo;t stay out there&mdash;afterward. The
      loneliness....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave you loneliness,&rdquo; she burst out
      passionately under her breath. &ldquo;I wanted to leave you memory and
      ambition and the determination to succeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; no!&rdquo; She answered the harsh thought subtending his
      query. &ldquo;Not for myself. Not for any pride. I&rsquo;m not cheap, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;re not cheap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have kept my distance.... It was quite true what I said to
      you about Betty Raleigh. It was not success alone that I wanted for you; I
      wanted happiness, too. I owed you that&mdash;after my mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught up the last word. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve admitted to yourself,
      then, that it was a mistake?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I played the game,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t
      always play right. But one can always play fair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know your creed of sportsmanship. There are worse religions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I played fair with you, Ban? After that night on the
      river?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I didn&rsquo;t kiss you good-bye in the station?
      Not really kiss you, I mean, as I did on the island?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if I had, I should never have had the strength to go away.&rdquo;
      She lifted her eyes to his. Her voice fell to a half whisper. &ldquo;You
      understood, on the island?... What I meant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t take me. I wonder. Ban, if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for the light flashing in our eyes and giving us hope...?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell? I was dazed with the amazement and the glory of it&mdash;of
      you. But&mdash;yes. My God, yes! And then? Afterward?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could there have been any afterward?&rdquo; she questioned
      dreamily. &ldquo;Would we not just have waited for the river to sweep us
      up and carry us away? What other ending could there have been, so fitting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he said with a sudden savage jealousy, &ldquo;whatever
      happened you would not have gone away to marry Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I not? I&rsquo;m by no means sure. You don&rsquo;t
      understand much of me, my poor Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Would that have been&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should have told him, of course. I&rsquo;d have said, &lsquo;Del,
      there&rsquo;s been another man, a lover.&rsquo; One could say those things
      to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he have married you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t, would you?&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;All or
      nothing, Ban, for you. About Del, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She shrugged
      dainty shoulders. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have much cared.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you have come back to me, Io?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;? You do want me to say&rsquo;
      Yes,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you, my dear? How can I tell?... Sooner or later,
      I suppose. Fate. The irresistible current. I am here now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io.&rdquo; He leaned to her across the little table, his somber
      regard holding hers. &ldquo;Why did you tell Camilla Van Arsdale that you
      would never divorce Eyre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why tell her? So that it should come back to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him straight and fearlessly. &ldquo;Yes. I thought it would
      be easier for you to hear from her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; He sat staring past her at visions. It was not
      within Banneker&rsquo;s code, his sense of fair play in the game, to
      betray to Io his wonderment (shared by most of her own set) that she
      should have endured the affront of Del Eyre&rsquo;s openly flagitious
      life, even though she had herself implied some knowledge of it in her
      assumption that a divorce could be procured. However, Io met his reticence
      with characteristic candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know about Del. We have a perfect understanding. He&rsquo;s
      agreed to maintain the outward decencies, from now on. I don&rsquo;t
      consider that I&rsquo;ve the right to ask more. You see, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have married him ... even though he understood that I wasn&rsquo;t really
      in love with him. We&rsquo;re friends; and we&rsquo;re going to remain
      friends. Just that. Del&rsquo;s a good sort,&rdquo; she added with a hint
      of pleading the cause of a misunderstood person. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d give me
      my divorce in a minute; even though he still cares&mdash;in his way. But
      there&rsquo;s his mother. She&rsquo;s a sort of latter-day saint; one of
      those rare people that you respect and love in equal parts; the only other
      one I know is Cousin Willis Enderby. She&rsquo;s an invalid, hopeless, and
      a Roman Catholic, and for me to divorce Del would poison the rest of her
      life. So I won&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t live forever,&rdquo; muttered Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not long, perhaps.&rdquo; There was pain and resolution in Io&rsquo;s
      eyes as they were lifted to meet his again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another
      reason. I can&rsquo;t tell even you, Ban. The secret isn&rsquo;t mine....
      I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any work to do to-day?&rdquo; she asked after a
      pause, with a successful effect of lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself, settled the check, and took her to her car, parked near
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you go now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Panem et Circenses; bread and the Big Show. The diagnosis of the
      satyr-like mathematician had been accurate. That same method whereby the
      tyrants of Rome had sought to beguile the restless and unthinking
      multitude, Banneker adopted to capture and lead the sensation-avid
      metropolitan public through his newspaper. As a facture, a creation made
      to the mind of the creator, The Patriot was Banneker&rsquo;s own. True,
      Marrineal reserved full control. But Marrineal, after a few months spent
      in anxious observation of his editor&rsquo;s headlong and revolutionary
      method, had taken the sales reports for his determinative guide and
      decided to give the new man full sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circulation had gone up as water rises in a tube under irresistible
      pressure from beneath. Nothing like it had ever been known in local
      journalism. Barring some set-back, within four years of the time when
      Banneker&rsquo;s introductory editorial appeared, the paper would have
      eclipsed all former records. In less than two years it had climbed to
      third place, and already Banneker&rsquo;s salary, under the percentage
      agreement, was, in the words of the alliterative Gardner, whose article
      describing The House With Three Eyes and its owner had gone forth on the
      wings of a far-spreading syndicate, &ldquo;a stupendous stipend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s editorials pervaded and gave the keynote. With sublime
      self-confidence he had adopted the untried scheme of having no set and
      determined place for the editorial department. Sometimes, his page
      appeared in the middle of the paper; sometimes on the back; and once, when
      a most promising scheme of municipal looting was just about to be put
      through, he fired his blast from the front sheet in extra heavy,
      double-leaded type, displacing an international yacht race and a most
      titillating society scandal with no more explanation than was to be found
      in the opening sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is more important to YOU, Mr. New Yorker, than any other news
      in to-day&rsquo;s issue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where Banneker sits,&rdquo; Russell Edmonds was wont to remark
      between puffs, &ldquo;is the head of the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em look for the stuff,&rdquo; said Banneker confidently.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think all the more of it when they find it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Often he used inset illustrations, not so much to give point to his
      preachments, as to render them easier of comprehension to the unthinking.
      And always he sought the utmost of sensationalism in caption and in type,
      employing italics, capitals, and even heavy-face letters with an effect of
      detonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jollies you along until he can see the white of your mind, and then
      fires his slug into your head, point-blank,&rdquo; Edmonds said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this he had the high art to keep his style direct, unaffected,
      almost severe. No frills, no literary graces, no flashes of wit except an
      occasional restrained touch of sarcasm: the writing was in the purest
      style and of a classic simplicity. The typical reader of The Patriot had a
      friendly and rather patronizing feeling for the editorials: they were
      generally deemed quite ordinary, &ldquo;common as an old shoe&rdquo; (with
      an approving accent from the commentator), comfortably devoid of the
      intricate elegancies practiced by Banneker&rsquo;s editorial compeers. So
      they were read and absorbed, which was all that their writer hoped or
      wished for them. He was not seeking the bubble, reputation, but the solid
      satisfaction of implanting ideas in minds hitherto unaroused to mental
      processes, and training the resultant thought in his chosen way and to
      eventual though still vague purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beginning to imitate you, Ban,&rdquo; commented
      Russell Edmonds in the days of The Patriot&rsquo;s first surprising upward
      leap. &ldquo;Flattery of your peers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em imitate,&rdquo; returned Banneker indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they don&rsquo;t come very near to the original. It&rsquo;s a
      fundamental difference in style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fundamental difference in aim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re writing at and for their owners; to make good with
      the boss. I&rsquo;m writing at my public.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s more difficult, though,
      isn&rsquo;t it, to write for a hundred thousand people than at one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you understand them from study at first hand, as I do. That&rsquo;s
      why the other fellows are five or ten-thousand-dollar men,&rdquo; said
      Banneker, quite without boastfulness &ldquo;while I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fifty-thousand-dollar a year man,&rdquo; supplied Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, getting toward that figure. I&rsquo;m on the target with the
      editorials and I&rsquo;m going to hold on it. But our news policy is
      different. We still wobble there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want! Look at the circulation. Isn&rsquo;t that good
      enough?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Every time I get into a street-car and see a passenger reading
      some other paper, I feel that we&rsquo;ve missed fire,&rdquo; returned
      Banneker inexorably. &ldquo;Pop, did you ever see an actress make up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a general notion of the process.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find me a man who can make up news ready and rouged to go before
      the daily footlights as an actress makes up her face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran grunted. &ldquo;Not to be found on Park Row.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. Park Row is too deadly conventional.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      One might suppose that the environment of religious journalism would be
      equally conventional. Yet it was from this department that the &ldquo;find&rdquo;
      eventually came, conducted by Edmonds. Edgar Severance, ten years older
      than Banneker, impressed the guiding spirit of The Patriot at first sight
      with a sense of inner certitude and serenity not in the least impaired by
      his shabbiness which had the redeeming merit of being clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a newspaper man?&rdquo; said Banneker after the
      introduction. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a prostitute,&rdquo; answered the other equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker smiled. &ldquo;Where have you practiced your profession?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As assistant editor of Guidance. I write the blasphemous editorials
      which are so highly regarded by the sweetly simple souls that make up our
      <i>clientèle</i>; the ones which weekly give gratuitous advice to God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Edmonds find you there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; put in the veteran; &ldquo;I traced him down through
      some popular scientific stuff in the Boston Sunday Star.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fake, all of it,&rdquo; proffered Severance. &ldquo;Otherwise it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be popular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your creed of journalism?&rdquo; asked Banneker curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Largely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why come to The Patriot, then? It isn&rsquo;t ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Severance raised his fine eyebrows, but contented himself with saying:
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? However, I didn&rsquo;t come. I was brought.&rdquo;
      He indicated Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave me more ideas on news-dressing,&rdquo; said the veteran,
      &ldquo;than I&rsquo;d pick up in a century on the Row.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideas are what we&rsquo;re after. Where do you get yours, Mr.
      Severance, since you are not a practical newspaper man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From talking with people, and seeing what the newspapers fail to
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you before you went on Guidance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instructor at Harvard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you practiced your&mdash;er&mdash;specified profession there,
      too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I was partly respectable then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? You don&rsquo;t build up much of a character for yourself as
      prospective employee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I join The Patriot staff I shall probably disappear once a month
      or so on a spree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you join The Patriot staff? That is what you fail to
      make clear to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reference, Mr. Russell Edmonds,&rdquo; returned the other
      negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two aren&rsquo;t getting anywhere with all this chatter,&rdquo;
      growled the reference. &ldquo;Come, Severance; talk turkey, as you did to
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk,&rdquo; objected the other in his
      gentle, scholarly accents. &ldquo;I want to look about: to diagnose the
      trouble in the news department.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suspect the trouble to be?&rdquo; asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the universal difficulty. Lack of brains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed, but without relish. &ldquo;We pay enough for what we&rsquo;ve
      got. It ought to be good quality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay not wisely but too well. My own princely emolument as a
      prop of piety is thirty-five dollars a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you come here at that figure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer forty. For a period of six weeks, on trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Mr. Edmonds seems to think it worth the gamble, I&rsquo;ll take
      you on. From to-day, if you wish. Go out and look around.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; interposed Edmonds. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his
      title? How is his job to be defined?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him my representative in the news department. I&rsquo;ll pay
      his salary myself. If he makes good, I&rsquo;ll more than get it back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Severance&rsquo;s first concern appeared to be to make himself
      popular. In the anomalous position which he occupied as representative
      between two mutually jealous departments, this was no easy matter. But his
      quiet, contained courtesy, his tentative, almost timid, way of offering
      suggestions or throwing out hints which subsequently proved to have
      definite and often surprising value, his retiring willingness to waive any
      credit in favor of whosoever might choose to claim it, soon gave him an
      assured if inconspicuous position. His advice was widely sought. As an
      immediate corollary a new impress made itself felt in the daily columns.
      With his quick sensitiveness Banneker apprehended the change. It seemed to
      him that the paper was becoming feminized in a curious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a play for the women?&rdquo; he asked Severance in the early
      days of the development.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly specializing on femaleness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the men. Not the women. It&rsquo;s an old lure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker frowned. &ldquo;And not a pretty one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Effective, though. I bagged it from the Police Gazette. Have you
      ever had occasion to note the almost unvarying cover appeal of that justly
      popular weekly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-dressed women,&rdquo; said Banneker, whose early researches
      had extended even to those levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. With all they connote. Thereby attracting the crude and
      roving male eye. Of course, we must do the trick more artistically and
      less obviously. But the pictured effect is the thing. I&rsquo;m satisfied
      of that. By the way, I am having a little difficulty with your art
      department. Your man doesn&rsquo;t adapt himself to new ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought him rather old-fashioned. What do you want to
      do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring in a young chap named Capron whom I&rsquo;ve run upon. He
      used to be an itinerant photographer, and afterward had a try at the
      movies, but he&rsquo;s essentially a news man. Let him read the papers for
      pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Capron came on the staff as an insignificant member with an insignificant
      salary. Personally a man of blameless domesticity, he was intellectually
      and professionally a sex-monger. He conceived the business of a news art
      department to be to furnish pictured Susannahs for the delectation of the
      elders of the reading public. His <i>flair</i> for femininity he
      transferred to The Patriot&rsquo;s pages, according to a simple and direct
      formula; the greater the display of woman, the surer the appeal and
      therefore the sale. Legs and bosoms he specialized for in illustrations.
      Bathing-suits and boudoir scenes were his particular aim, although any
      picture with a scandal attachment in the accompanying news would serve,
      the latter, however, to be handled in such manner as invariably to point a
      moral. Herein his team work with Severance was applied in high perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should Our Girls Become Artists&rsquo; Models&rdquo; was one of
      their early and inspired collaborations, a series begun with a line of
      &ldquo;beauty pictures&rdquo; and spun out by interviews with well or less
      known painters and illustrators, giving rich opportunity for displays of
      nudity, the moral being pointed by equally lavish interviews with
      sociologists and prominent Mothers in Israel. Although at least
      ninety-nine per cent of all professional posing is such as would not be
      out of place at a church sociable, the casual reader of the
      Capron-Severance presentation would have supposed that a lace veil was the
      extent of the protection allowed to a female model between sheer nakedness
      and the outer artistic world. Following this came a department devoted
      (ostensibly) to physical culture for women. It was conducted by the
      proprietress of a fashionable reducing gymnasium, who was allowed, as this
      was a comparatively unimportant feature, to supply the text subject to
      Severance&rsquo;s touching-up ingenuity; but the models were devised and
      posed by Capron. They were extremely shapely and increasingly expressive
      in posture and arrangement until they attained a point where the
      post-office authorities evinced symptoms of rising excitement&mdash;though
      not the type of excitement at which the Art Expert was aiming&mdash;when
      the series took a turn for the milder, and more purely athletic, and, by
      the same token, less appetizing; and presently faded away in a burst of
      semi-editorial self-laudation over The Patriot&rsquo;s altruistic
      endeavors to improve the physical status of the &ldquo;future mothers of
      the nation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing any other excuse for their careful lubricities, the team could
      always conjure up an enticing special feature from an imaginary foreign
      correspondent, aimed direct at the family circle and warning against the
      &ldquo;Moral Pitfalls of Paris,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Vampires of High Life
      in Vienna.&rdquo; The invariable rule was that all sex-stuff must have a
      moral and virtuous slant. Thus was afforded to the appreciative reader a
      double satisfaction, physical and ethical, pruriency and piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Capron who devised the simple but effective legend which afterward
      became, in a thousand variants, a stock part of every news item
      interesting enough to merit graphic treatment, &ldquo;The X Marks the Spot
      Where the Body Was Found.&rdquo; He, too, adapted, from a design in a
      drug-store window picturing a sponge fisherman in action, the
      cross-section illustration for news. Within a few weeks he had displaced
      the outdated art editor and was in receipt of a larger salary than the
      city editor, who dealt primarily in news, not sensations, <i>panem</i> not
      <i>circenses</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensationalism of other kinds was spurred to keep pace with the sex
      appeal. The news columns became constantly more lurid. They shrieked,
      yelled, blared, shrilled, and boomed the scandals and horrors of the
      moment in multivocal, multigraphic clamor, tainting the peaceful air
      breathed by everyday people going about their everyday business, with
      incredible blatancies which would be forgotten on the morrow in the
      excitement of fresh percussions, though the cumulative effect upon the
      public mind and appetite might be ineradicable. &ldquo;Murderer Dabbles
      Name in Bloody Print.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wronged Wife Mars Rival&rsquo;s
      Beauty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Society Woman Gives Hundred-Dollar-Plate Dinner.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Scientist Claims Life Flickers in Mummy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cocktails,
      Wine, Drug, Ruin for Lovely Girl of Sixteen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Financier
      Resigns After Sprightly Scene at Long Beach.&rdquo; Severance developed a
      literary genius for excitant and provocative word-combinations in the
      headings; &ldquo;Love-Slave,&rdquo; &ldquo;Girl-Slasher,&rdquo; &ldquo;Passion-Victim,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Death-Hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vengeance-Oath,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lust-Fiend.&rdquo;
      The articles chosen for special display were such as lent themselves,
      first, to his formula for illustration, and next to captions which
      thrilled with the sensations of crime, mystery, envy of the rich and
      conspicuous, or lechery, half concealed or unconcealed. For facts as such
      he cared nothing. His conception of news was as a peg upon which to hang a
      sensation. &ldquo;Love and luxury for the women: money and power for the
      men,&rdquo; was his broad working scheme for the special interest of the
      paper, with, of course, crime and the allure of the flesh for general
      interest. A jungle man, perusing one day&rsquo;s issue (supposing him to
      have been competent to assimilate it), would have judged the civilization
      pictured therein too grisly for his unaccustomed nerves and fled in horror
      back to the direct, natural, and uncomplicated raids and homicides of the
      decent wilds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Gaines, descending for once from the habitual classicism of his
      phraseology, described The Patriot of Severance&rsquo;s production in two
      terse and sufficient words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It itches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That itch irked Banneker almost unendurably at times. He longed to be
      relieved of it; to scratch the irritant Severance clean off the skin of
      The Patriot. But Severance was too evidently valuable. Banneker did go so
      far as to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you rather overdoing this thing, Severance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which thing? We&rsquo;re overdoing everything; hence the growth of
      the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker fell back upon banality. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to draw the
      line somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Severance bestowed upon the other his well-bred and delicate smile.
      &ldquo;Exactly my principle. I&rsquo;m for drawing the line every issue
      and on every page, if there&rsquo;s room for it. &lsquo;<i>Nulla dies sine
      linea</i>.&rsquo; The line of appeal to the sensations, whether it&rsquo;s
      a pretty face or a caption that jumps out and grabs you by the eye. I want
      to make &rsquo;em gloat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. You were in earnest more or less when in our first talk, you
      defined your profession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Severance waved a graceful hand. &ldquo;Prostitution is the profession of
      all successful journalism which looks at itself honestly. Why not play the
      pander frankly?&mdash;among ourselves, of course. Perhaps I&rsquo;m
      offending you, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re interesting me. But, &lsquo;among ourselves&rsquo; you
      say. You&rsquo;re not a newspaper man; you haven&rsquo;t the traditions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I haven&rsquo;t the blind spots. I&rsquo;m not fooled by
      the sentimentalism of the profession or the sniveling claims of being an
      apostle of public enlightenment. If enlightenment pays, all very well. But
      it&rsquo;s circulation, not illumination, that&rsquo;s the prime
      desideratum. Frankly, I&rsquo;d feed the public gut with all it can and
      will stand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even to the extent of keeping the Tallman divorce scandal on the
      front page for a week consecutively. You won&rsquo;t pretend that, as
      news, it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a definition of news,&rdquo; retorted the expert. &ldquo;The
      Tallman story won&rsquo;t alter the history of the world. But it has its&mdash;well,
      its specialized value for our purposes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Banneker, deliberately stimulating his own
      growing nausea, &ldquo;that it makes the public&rsquo;s mind itch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty filthy and scabby sort of animal, the public,
      Mr. Banneker. We&rsquo;re not trying to reform its morals in our news
      columns, I take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No; we&rsquo;re not. Still&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the province of your editorials,&rdquo; went on the
      apostle of titillation smoothly. &ldquo;You may in time even educate them
      up to a standard of decency where they won&rsquo;t demand the sort of
      thing we&rsquo;re giving them now. But our present business with the news
      columns is to catch them for you to educate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so! You lure them into the dive where I wait to preach them a
      sermon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that conversation Banneker definitely decided that Severance&rsquo;s
      activities must be curbed. But when he set about it, he suffered an
      unpleasant surprise. Marrineal, thoroughly apprised of the new man&rsquo;s
      activities (as he was, by some occult means of his own, of everything
      going on in the office), stood fast by the successful method, and let
      Banneker know, tactfully but unmistakably, that Severance, who had been
      transferred to the regular payroll at a highly satisfactory figure, was to
      have a free hand. So the ex-religious editor continued to stroll leisurely
      through his unauthoritative and influential routine, contributing his
      commentary upon the news as it flowed in. He would saunter over to the
      make-up man&rsquo;s clotted desk, run his eye over the dummy of the morrow&rsquo;s
      issue, and inquire;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there a shooting scrape over a woman in a big
      West-Side apartment?... Being kept by the chap that was shot, wasn&rsquo;t
      she?... Oh, a bank clerk?... Well, that&rsquo;s a pretty dull-looking
      seventh page. Why not lift this text of the new Suburban Railways Bill and
      spread the shooting across three columns? Get Sanderson to work out a
      diagram and do one of his filmy line drawings of the girl lying on the
      couch. And let&rsquo;s be sure to get the word &lsquo;Banker&rsquo; into
      the top head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or he would deliver a practical lecture from a text picked out of what to
      a less keen-scented news-hound might have appeared an unpromising subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we round out that disappearance story a little; the
      suburban woman who hasn&rsquo;t been seen since she went to New York three
      days ago? Get Capron to fake up a picture of the home with the three
      children in it grouped around Bereaved Husband, and&mdash;here, how would
      something like this do for caption: &lsquo;&ldquo;Mamma, Mamma! Come Back!&rdquo;
      Sob Tiny Tots.&rsquo; The human touch. Nothing like a bit of slush to
      catch the women. And we&rsquo;ve been going a little shy on sentiment
      lately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;human touch,&rdquo; though it became an office joke, also took
      its place as an unwritten law. Severance&rsquo;s calm and impersonal
      cynicism was transmuted into a genuine enthusiasm among the copy-readers.
      Headlining took on a new interest, whetted by the establishment of a
      weekly prize for the most attractive caption. Maximum of sensationalism
      was the invariable test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his growing distaste for the Severance cult, Banneker was honest
      enough to admit that the original stimulus dated from the day when he
      himself had injected his personality and ideas into the various
      departments of the daily. He had established the new policy; Severance had
      done no more than inform it with the heated imaginings and provocative
      pictorial quality inherent in a mind intensely if scornfully apprehensive
      of the unsatiated potential depravities of public taste. It was Banneker&rsquo;s
      hand that had set the strings vibrating to a new tune; Severance had only
      raised the pitch, to the <i>n</i>th degree of sensationalism. And, in so
      far as the editorial page gave him a lead, the disciple was faithful to
      the principles and policies of his chief. The practice of the news columns
      was always informed by a patently defensible principle. It paeaned the
      virtues of the poor and lowly; it howled for the blood of the wicked and
      the oppressor; it was strident for morality, the sanctity of the home,
      chastity, thrift, sobriety, the People, religion, American supremacy. As a
      corollary of these pious standards it invariably took sides against wealth
      and power, sentimentalized every woman who found her way into the public
      prints, whether she had perpetrated a murder or endowed a hospital,
      simpered and slavered over any &ldquo;heart-interest story&rdquo; of
      childhood (&ldquo;blue-eyed tot stuff&rdquo; was the technical office
      term), and licked reprehensive but gustful lips over divorce, adultery,
      and the sexual complications. It peeped through keyholes of print at the
      sanctified doings of Society and snarled while it groveled. All the
      shibboleths of a journalism which respected neither itself, its purpose,
      nor its readers echoed from every page. And this was the reflex of the
      work and thought of Errol Banneker, who intimately respected himself, and
      his profession as expressed in himself. There is much of the paradoxical
      in journalism&mdash;as, indeed, in the life which it distortedly mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every other newspaper in town caught the contagion; became by insensible
      degrees more sensational and pornographic. The Patriot had started a
      rag-time pace (based on the same fundamental instinct which the rhythm of
      rag-time expresses, if the psychologists are correct) and the rest must,
      perforce, adopt it. Such as lagged in this Harlot&rsquo;s Progress
      suffered a loss of circulation, journalism&rsquo;s most condign penalty.
      For there are certain appetites which, once stimulated, must be appeased.
      Otherwise business wanes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of conscious nothing, as represented by the now moribund News, there
      was provoked one evening a large, round, middle-aged, smiling,
      bespectacled apparition who named himself as Rudy Sheffer and invited
      himself to a job. Marrineal had sent him to Severance, and Severance, ever
      tactful, had brought him to Banneker. Russell Edmonds being called in, the
      three sat in judgment upon the Big Idea which Mr. Sheffer had brought with
      him and which was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em a laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The potentialities of humor as a circulation agency,&rdquo; opined
      Severance in his smoothest academic voice, &ldquo;have never been properly
      exploited.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A laugh on every page where there ain&rsquo;t a thrill,&rdquo;
      pursued Sheffer confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find some of our pages dull?&rdquo; asked Banneker, always
      interested in any new view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your market page ain&rsquo;t no scream. You gotta admit it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t usually want to laugh when they&rsquo;re
      studying the stock market,&rdquo; growled Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprise &rsquo;em, then. Give &rsquo;em a jab in the ribs and see
      how they like it. Pictures. Real comics. Anywhere in the paper that there&rsquo;s
      room for em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a cartoon on the editorial page,&rdquo;
      pointed out Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cartoon? What does that get you? A cartoon&rsquo;s an editorial,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell Edmonds shot a side glance at Banneker, meaning: &ldquo;This is no
      fool. Watch him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes &rsquo;em think, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; pursued the visitor.
      &ldquo;If it tickles &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s on the side. It gets after
      their minds, makes &rsquo;em work for what they get. That&rsquo;s an
      effort. See?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. What&rsquo;s your aim?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not their brains. I leave that to Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s editorials.
      I&rsquo;m after the laugh that starts down here.&rdquo; He laid hand upon
      his rotund waistcoat. &ldquo;The belly-laugh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anatomy of anti-melancholy,&rdquo; murmured Severance. &ldquo;Valuable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s valuable,&rdquo; declared its
      proponent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s money; that&rsquo;s what it is. Watch &rsquo;em
      at the movies. When their bellies begin to shake, the picture&rsquo;s got
      &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you produce this desirable effect?&rdquo; asked
      Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble to show goods. I&rsquo;m dealing with gents, I know.
      This is all under your shirt for the present, if you don&rsquo;t take up
      the scheme.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From a portfolio which he had set in a corner he produced a sheaf of
      drawings. They depicted the adventures, mischievous, predatory, or
      criminal, of a pair of young hopefuls whose physiognomies and postures
      were genuinely ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you draw these?&rdquo; asked Banneker in surprise, for the
      draughtsmanship was expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Hired a kid artist to do &rsquo;em. I furnished the idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you furnished the idea, did you?&rdquo; queried Edmonds.
      &ldquo;And where did you get it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an ineffably satisfied air, Mr. Sheffer tapped his bullet head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be older than you look, then. Those figures of the kids
      are redrawn from a last-century German humorous classic, &lsquo;Max und
      Moritz.&rsquo; I used to be crazy over it when I was a youngster. My
      grandfather brought it to me from Europe, and made a translation for us
      youngsters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Those pictures&rsquo;d make a reformer laugh. I picked up the
      book in German on an Ann Street sidewalk stand, caught the Big Idea right
      then and there; to Americanize the stuff and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For &lsquo;Americanize,&rsquo; read &lsquo;steal,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      commented Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no thin&rsquo; crooked in this,&rdquo; protested
      the other with sincerity. &ldquo;The stuff ain&rsquo;t copyrighted here. I
      looked that up particularly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, I believe,&rdquo; confirmed Severance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      an open field.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got ten series mapped out to start. Call &rsquo;em &lsquo;The
      Trouble-hunter Twins, Ruff and Reddy.&rsquo; If they catch on, the artist
      and me can keep &rsquo;em goin&rsquo; forever. And they&rsquo;ll catch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they will,&rdquo; said Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smeared across the top of a page it&rsquo;ll make a business man
      laugh as hard as a kid. I know business men. I was one, myself. Sold bar
      fixtures on the road for four years. And my best selling method was the
      laughs I got out of &rsquo;em. Used to take a bit of chalk and do sketches
      on the table-tops. So I know what makes &rsquo;em laugh. Belly-laughs. You
      make a business man laugh that way, and you get his business. It ain&rsquo;t
      circulation alone; it&rsquo;s advertising that the stuff will bring in.
      Eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; asked Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying,&rdquo; decided Banneker after thought.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so, do you, Pop?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go ahead!&rdquo; returned Edmonds, spewing forth a mouthful of
      smoke as if to expel a bad taste. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s larceny among
      friends?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not taking anything of value, since there&rsquo;s
      no copyright and any one can grab it,&rdquo; pointed out the smooth
      Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus there entered into the high-tension atmosphere of the sensationalized
      Patriot the relaxing quality of humor. Under the ingenuous and acquisitive
      Sheffer, whose twins achieved immediate popularity, it developed along
      other lines. Sheffer&mdash;who knew what makes business men laugh&mdash;pinned
      his simple faith to three main subjects, convulsive of the diaphragmatic
      muscles, building up each series upon the inherent humor to be extracted
      from physical violence as represented in the perpetrations and punishments
      of Ruff and Reddy, marital infidelity as mirrored in the stratagems and
      errancies of an amorous ape with an aged and jealous spouse, and the
      sure-fire familiarity of aged minstrel jokes (mother-in-law, country
      constable, young married cookery, and the like) refurbished in pictorial
      serials through the agency of two uproarious and imbecilic vulgarians,
      Bonehead and Buttinsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children cried for them, and laughed to exhaustion over them. Not less did
      the mentally exhausted business man writhe abdominally over their appeal.
      Spread across the top of three pages they wrung the profitable belly-laugh
      from growing thousands of new readers. If Banneker sometimes had
      misgivings that the educational influence of The Patriot was not notably
      improved by all this instigation of crime and immorality made subject for
      mirth in the mind of developing youth, he stifled them in the thought of
      increased reading public for his own columns. Furthermore, it was not his
      newspaper, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the editorial page was still peculiarly his own, and with that clarity
      of view which he never permitted personal considerations to prejudice,
      Banneker perceived that it was falling below pitch. Or, rather, that,
      while it remained static, the rest of the paper, under the stimulus of
      Severance, Capron, Sheffer, and, in the background but increasingly though
      subtly assertive, Marrineal, had raised its level of excitation. Change
      his editorials he would not. Nor was there need; the response to them was
      too widespread and fervent, their following too blindly fanatic, the
      opposition roused by them too furious to permit of any doubt as to their
      effectiveness. But that portion of the page not taken up by his writings
      and the cartoon (which was often based upon an idea supplied by him), was
      susceptible of alteration, of keying-up. Casting about him for the popular
      note, the circus appeal, he started a &ldquo;signed-article&rdquo;
      department of editorial contributions to which he invited any and all
      persons of prominence in whatever line. The lure of that universal egotism
      which loves to see itself in the public eye secured a surprising number of
      names. Propagandists were quick to appreciate the opportunity of The
      Patriot&rsquo;s wide circulation for furthering their designs, selfish or
      altruistic. To such desirables as could not be caught by other lures,
      Banneker offered generous payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this latter basis that he secured a prize, in the person of the
      Reverend George Bland, ex-revivalist, ex-author of pious stories for the
      young, skilled dealer in truisms, in wordy platitudes couched largely in
      plagiarized language from the poets and essayists, in all the
      pseudo-religious slickeries wherewith men&rsquo;s souls are so easily
      lulled into self-satisfaction. The Good, the True, the Beautiful; these
      were his texts, but the real god of his worship was Success. This, under
      the guise of Duty (&ldquo;man&rsquo;s God-inspired ambition to be true to
      his best possibilities&rdquo;), he preached day in and day out through his
      &ldquo;Daily Help&rdquo; in The Patriot: Be guided by me and you will be
      good: Be good and you will be prosperous: Be prosperous and you will be
      happy. On an adjoining page there were other and far more specific
      instructions as to how to be prosperous and happy, by backing Speedfoot at
      10 to 1 in the first race, or Flashaway at 5 to 2 in the third. Sometimes
      the Reverend Bland inveighed convincingly against the evils of betting.
      Yet a cynic might guess that the tipsters&rsquo; recipes for being
      prosperous and happy (and therefore, by a logical inversion, good) were
      perhaps as well based and practical as the reverend moralist&rsquo;s. His
      correspondence, surest indication of editorial following, grew to be
      almost as large as Banneker&rsquo;s. Severance nicknamed him &ldquo;the
      Oracle of Boobs,&rdquo; and for short he became known as the &ldquo;Booblewarbler,&rdquo;
      for there were times when he burst into verse, strongly reminiscent of the
      older hymnals. This he resented hotly and genuinely, for he was quite
      sincere; as sincere as Sheffer, in his belief in himself. But he despised
      Sheffer and feared Severance, not for what the latter represented, but for
      the cynical honesty of his attitude. In retort for Severance&rsquo;s stab,
      he dubbed the pair Mephistopheles and Falstaff, which was above his usual
      felicitousness of characterization. Sheffer (who read Shakespeare to
      improve his mind, and for ideas!) was rather flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the platitudinous Bland had his practical inspirations; if they had
      not been practical, they would not have been Bland&rsquo;s. One of these
      was an analysis of the national business character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We Americans,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are natural merchandisers. We
      care less for the making of a thing than for the selling of it.
      Salesmanship is the great American game. It calls forth all our native
      genius; it is the expression of our originality, our inventiveness, our
      ingenuity, our idealism,&rdquo; and so on, for a full column slathered
      with deadly and self-betraying encomiums. For the Reverend Bland believed
      heartily that the market was the highest test of humankind. <i>He</i>
      would rather sell a thing than make it! In fact, anything made with any
      other purpose than to sell would probably not be successful, and would
      fail to make its author prosperous; therefore it must be wrong. Not the
      creator, but the salesman was the modern evangel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Booblewarbler has given away the game,&rdquo; commented
      Severance with his slight, ironic smile, the day when this naive effusion
      appeared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, of course. But he thinks he&rsquo;s
      praising when he&rsquo;s damning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was disturbed. But the flood of letters which came in promptly
      reassured him. The Reverend editorializer was hailed broadcast as the
      Messiah of the holy creed of Salesmanship, of the high cult of getting rid
      of something for more than it is worth. He was organized into a lecture
      tour; his department in the paper waxed ever greater. Banneker, with his
      swift appreciation of a hit, followed the lead with editorials; hired
      authors to write short stories glorifying the ennobled figure of the
      Salesman, his smartness, his strategy, his ruthless trickery, his success.
      And the salesmanhood of the nation, in trains, in hotel lobbies, at the
      breakfast table with its Patriot propped up flanking the egg and coffee,
      rose up to call him blessed and to add to his income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal experiences in achieving success were a logical sequence to this;
      success in any field, from running a city as set forth by His Honor the
      Mayor, to becoming a movie star, by all the movie stars or aspirants whom
      their press-agents could crowd into the paper. A distinguished novelist of
      notably high blood-pressure contributed a series of thoughtful essays on
      &ldquo;How to be Irresistible in Love,&rdquo; and a sentimental pugilist
      indulged in reminiscences (per a hired pen from the cheap magazine field)
      upon &ldquo;The Influence of my Mother on my Career.&rdquo; An imitator of
      Banneker developed a daily half-column of self-improvement and inspiration
      upon moral topics, achieving his effects by capitalizing all the words
      which otherwise would have been too feeble or banal to attract notice,
      thereby giving an air of sublimated importance to the mildly
      incomprehensible. Nine tenths of The Patriot&rsquo;s editorial readers
      believed that they were following a great philosopher along the path of
      the eternal profundities. To give a touch of science, an amateur
      astronomer wrote stirring imaginative articles on interstellar space, and
      there were occasional &ldquo;authoritative&rdquo; pronouncements by men of
      importance in the political, financial, or intellectual worlds, lifted
      from public speeches or old publications. The page, if it did not actually
      itch, buzzed and clanged. But above the composite clamor rose ever the
      voice of Banneker, clear, serene, compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Banneker took his pay for it, deeming it well earned.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Life was broadening out before Banneker into new and golden persuasions.
      He had become a person of consequence, a force to be reckoned with, in the
      great, unheeding city. By sheer resolute thinking and planning, expressed
      and fulfilled in unsparing labor, he had made opportunity lead to
      opportunity until his position was won. He was courted, sought after,
      accepted by representative people of every sort, their interest and liking
      answering to his broad but fine catholicity of taste in human
      relationships. If he had no intimates other than Russell Edmonds, it was
      because he felt no need of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found Io again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prophecies had all failed in the matter of his rise. He thought, with
      pardonable exultation, of how he had confuted them, one after another.
      Cressey had doubted that one could be at the same time a successful
      journalist and a gentleman; Horace Vanney had deemed individuality
      inconsistent with newspaper writing; Tommy Burt and other jejune
      pessimists of the craft had declared genuine honesty incompatible with the
      higher and more authoritative phases of the profession. Almost without set
      plan and by an inevitable progress, as it now seemed to him, he had risen
      to the most conspicuous, if not yet the most important, position on Park
      Row, and had suffered no conscious compromise of standards, whether of
      self-respect, self-assertion, or honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he ever allowed monetary considerations seriously to concern him, he
      might have been troubled by an untoward and not easily explicable
      phenomenon. His bank account consistently failed to increase in ratio to
      his earnings. In fact, what with tempting investments, the importunities
      of a highly luxurious taste in life hitherto unsuspected, and an
      occasional gambling flyer, his balance was precarious, so to speak. With
      the happy optimism of one to whom the rosy present casts an intensified
      glow upon the future, he confidently anticipated a greatly and steadily
      augmented income, since the circulation of The Patriot was now the terror
      of its rivals. That any radical alteration could be made in his method of
      recompense did not occur to him. So completely had he identified himself
      with The Patriot that he subconsciously regarded himself as essential to
      its prosperity if not to its actual existence. Therein he was supported by
      all the expert opinion of Park Row. Already he had accepted one
      modification of his contract, and his takings for new circulation were now
      twenty-five cents per unit per year instead of fifty cents as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tertius Marrineal and his business manager, a shrewd and practical
      gentleman named Haring, had done a vast deal of expert figuring, as a
      result of which the owner strolled into his editor&rsquo;s office one noon
      with his casual air of having nothing else to do, and pleasantly inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t be worth much,&rdquo; returned
      Banneker, in a cheerful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you can spare me fifteen minutes&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; Banneker swiveled his chair to face the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you that the paper is a success; a big
      success,&rdquo; began Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s always pleasant to hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly too big a success. What would you say to letting
      circulation drop for a while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Banneker felt a momentary queer sensation near the pit
      of his stomach. If the circulation dropped, his income followed it. But
      could Marrineal be serious?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is we&rsquo;ve reached the point where more circulation is
      a luxury. We&rsquo;re printing an enormous paper, and wood-pulp prices are
      going up. If we could raise our advertising rates;&mdash;but Mr. Haring
      thinks that three raises a year is all the traffic will bear. The fact is,
      Mr. Banneker, that the paper isn&rsquo;t making money. We&rsquo;ve run
      ahead of ourselves. You&rsquo;re swallowing all the profits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s inner voice said warningly to Banneker, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s
      it.&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s outer voice said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the matter of advertising. Your policy is not
      helping us much there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The advertising is increasing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in proportion to circulation. Nothing like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the proper ratio isn&rsquo;t maintained, that is the concern of
      the advertising department, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much the concern. Will you talk with Mr. Haring about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in Banneker&rsquo;s editorship it had been agreed that he should
      keep free of any business or advertising complications. Experience and the
      warnings of Russell Edmonds had told him that the only course of editorial
      independence lay in totally ignoring the effect of what he might write
      upon the profits and prejudices of the advertisers, who were, of course,
      the principal support of the paper. Furthermore, Banneker heartily
      despised about half of the advertising which the paper carried; dubious
      financial proffers, flamboyant mercantile copy of diamond dealers, cheap
      tailors, installment furniture profiteers, the lure of loan sharks and
      race-track tipsters, and the specious and deadly fallacies of the medical
      quacks. Appealing as it did to an ignorant and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; class of
      the public (&ldquo;Banneker&rsquo;s First-Readers,&rdquo; Russell Edmonds
      was wont to call them), The Patriot offered a profitable field for all the
      pitfall-setters of print. The less that Banneker knew about them the more
      comfortable would he be. So he turned his face away from those columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negative which he returned to Marrineal&rsquo;s question was no more
      or less than that astute gentleman expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We carried an editorial last week on cigarettes, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
      a Yellow Stain on Your Boy&rsquo;s Fingers&mdash;Is There Another on his
      Character?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is still bringing in letters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. Letters of protest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the tobacco people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Mr. Banneker, don&rsquo;t you regard tobacco as a
      legitimate article of use?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, entirely. Couldn&rsquo;t do without it, myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why attack it, then, in your column?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my column,&rdquo; answered Banneker with perceptible
      emphasis on the possessive, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t believe that cigarettes
      are good for boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody does. But the effect of your editorial is to play into the
      hands of the anti-tobacco people. It&rsquo;s an indiscriminate onslaught
      on all tobacco. That&rsquo;s the effect of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the result is that the tobacco people are threatening to cut us
      off from their new advertising appropriation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of my department,&rdquo; said Banneker calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal was a patient man. He pursued. &ldquo;You have offended the
      medical advertisers by your support of the so-called Honest Label Bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good bill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly a quarter of our advertising revenue is from the
      patent-medicine people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mostly swindlers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They pay your salary,&rdquo; Marrineal pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; said Banneker vigorously. &ldquo;The paper pays my
      salary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without the support of the very advertisers that you are attacking,
      it couldn&rsquo;t continue to pay it. Yet you decline to admit any
      responsibility to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely. To them or for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I can&rsquo;t see your basis,&rdquo; said the reasonable
      Marrineal. &ldquo;Considering what you have received in income from the
      paper&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have worked for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitted. But that you should absorb practically all the profits&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      that a little lopsided, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your proposition, Mr. Marrineal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal put his long, delicate fingers together, tip to tip before his
      face, and appeared to be carefully reckoning them up. About the time when
      he might reasonably have been expected to have audited the total and found
      it to be the correct eight with two supplementary thumbs, he ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coöperation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the editorial page and the advertising department?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said profit-sharing. I propose that in lieu
      of our present arrangement, based upon a percentage on a circulation which
      is actually becoming a liability instead of an asset, we should reckon
      your salary on a basis of the paper&rsquo;s net earnings.&rdquo; As
      Banneker, sitting with thoughtful eyes fixed upon him, made no comment, he
      added: &ldquo;To show that I do not underestimate your value to the paper,
      I propose to pay you fifteen per cent of the net earnings for the next
      three years. By the way, it won&rsquo;t be necessary hereafter, for you to
      give any time to the news or Sunday features.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ve got out of me about all you could on that side,&rdquo;
      observed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The policy is established and successful, thanks largely to you. I
      would be the last to deny it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon as my probable income under the proposed
      arrangement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered the proprietor apologetically, &ldquo;it
      would be somewhat reduced this year. If our advertising revenue increases,
      as it naturally should, your percentage might easily rise above your
      earnings under the old arrangement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; commented Banneker thoughtfully. &ldquo;You propose
      to make it worth my while to walk warily. As the pussy foots it, so to
      speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you to recognize the fairness of the proposition that you
      conduct your column in the best interests of the concern&mdash;which,
      under the new arrangement, would also be your own best interests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clear. Limpidly clear,&rdquo; murmured Banneker. &ldquo;And if I
      decline the new basis, what is the alternative?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut down circulation, and with it, loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other, the real alternative?&rdquo; queried the
      imperturbable Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal smiled, with a touch of appeal in his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankness is best, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; propounded the editor.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe, Mr. Marrineal, that this paper can get along
      without me. It has become too completely identified with my editorial
      idea. On the other hand, I can get along without it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By accepting the offer of the Mid-West Evening Syndicate, beginning
      at forty thousand a year?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re well posted,&rdquo; said Banneker, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of necessity. What would you suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your information is fairly accurate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared to make you a guarantee of forty thousand, as a
      minimum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make nearer sixty than fifty this year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the expense of a possible loss to the paper. Come, Mr. Banneker;
      the fairness of my offer is evident. A generous guarantee, and a brilliant
      chance of future profits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And</i> a free hand with my editorials?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that will arrange itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely what I fear.&rdquo; Banneker had been making some swift
      calculations on his desk-blotter. Now he took up a blue pencil and with a
      gesture, significant and not without dramatic effect, struck it down
      through the reckoning. &ldquo;No, Mr. Marrineal. It isn&rsquo;t good
      enough. I hold to the old status. When our contract is out&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, Mr. Banneker. Isn&rsquo;t there a French proverb,
      something about no man being as indispensable as he thinks?&rdquo;
      Marrineal&rsquo;s voice was never more suave and friendly. &ldquo;Before
      you make any final decision, look these over.&rdquo; He produced from his
      pocket half a dozen of what appeared to be Patriot editorial clippings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of The Patriot glanced rapidly through them. A puzzled frown
      appeared on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I write these?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dam&rsquo; good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also, they&rsquo;re dam&rsquo; thievery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you mean flattery. In its sincerest form. Imitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect. I could believe I&rsquo;d written them myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve been a very careful student of The Patriot&rsquo;s
      editorial style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Patriot&rsquo;s! Mine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not. You would hardly contend seriously that, having paid
      the longest price on record for the editorials, The Patriot has not a
      vested right in them and their style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Banneker thoughtfully. Inwardly he cursed
      himself for the worst kind of a fool; the fool who underestimates the
      caliber of his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you say,&rdquo; continued the smooth voice of the other,
      &ldquo;that these might be mistaken for your work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody would know the difference. It&rsquo;s robbery of the rankest
      kind. But it&rsquo;s infernally clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to quarrel with you over a definition, Mr.
      Banneker,&rdquo; said Marrineal. He leaned a little forward with a smile
      so frank and friendly that it quite astonished the other. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
      not going to let you go, either,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;You need me and
      I need you. I&rsquo;m not fool enough to suppose that the imitation can
      ever continue to be as good as the real thing. We&rsquo;ll make it a fifty
      thousand guarantee, if you say so. And, as for your editorial policy&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;ll take a chance on your seeing reason. After all, there&rsquo;s
      plenty of earth to prance on without always treading on people&rsquo;s
      toes.... Well, don&rsquo;t decide now. Take your time to it.&rdquo; He
      rose and went to the door. There he turned, flapping the loose imitations
      in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banneker,&rdquo; he said chuckling, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t they really
      dam&rsquo; good!&rdquo; and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment Banneker felt a surge of the first real liking he had ever
      known for his employer. Marrineal had been purely human for a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in the first revulsion after the proprietor had left,
      Banneker&rsquo;s unconquered independence rose within him, jealous and
      clamant. He felt repressions, claims, interferences potentially closing in
      upon his pen, also an undefined dread of the sharply revealed overseer.
      That a force other than his own mind and convictions should exert
      pressure, even if unsuccessful, upon his writings, was intolerable. Better
      anything than that. The Mid-West Syndicate, he knew, would leave him
      absolutely untrammeled. He would write the general director at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the act of beginning the letter, the thought struck and stunned him
      that this would mean leaving New York. Going to live in a Middle-Western
      city, a thousand miles outside of the orbit in which moved Io Eyre!
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the letter unfinished, and the issue to the fates.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Put to the direct question, as, for example, on the witness stand, Mr. Ely
      Ives would, before his connection with Tertius Marrineal, have probably
      identified himself as a press-agent. In that capacity he had acted, from
      time to time, for a railroad with many axes to grind, a widespread
      stock-gambling enterprise, a minor political ring, a liquor combination,
      and a millionaire widow from the West who innocently believed that
      publicity, as manipulated by Mr. Ives, could gain social prestige for her
      in the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every phase of his employment, the ex-medical student had gathered
      curious and valuable lore. In fact he was one of those acquisitive persons
      who collect and hoard scandals, a miser of private and furtive
      information. His was the zeal of the born collector; something of the
      genius, too: he boasted a keen instinct. In his earlier and more
      precarious days he had formed the habit of watching for and collating all
      possible advices concerning those whom he worked for or worked against and
      branching from them to others along radiating lines of business, social,
      or family relationships. To him New York was a huge web, of sinister and
      promising design, dim, involved, too often impenetrable in the corners
      where the big spiders spin. He had two guiding maxims: &ldquo;It may come
      in handy some day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all bear watching.&rdquo;
      Before the prosperous time, he had been, in his devotion to his guiding
      principles, a practitioner of the detective arts in some of their least
      savory phases; had haunted doorsteps, lurked upon corners, been rained
      upon, snowed upon, possibly spat upon, even arrested; all of which he
      accepted, mournful but uncomplaining. One cannot whole-heartedly serve an
      ideal and come off scatheless. He was adroit, well-spoken, smooth of
      surface, easy of purse, untiring, supple, and of an inexhaustible
      good-humor. It was from the ex-medical student that Marrineal had learned
      of Banneker&rsquo;s offer from the Syndicate, also of his over-prodigal
      hand in money matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to have the cash,&rdquo; was the expert&rsquo;s
      opinion upon Banneker. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your hold on him.... Quit? No
      danger. New York&rsquo;s in his blood. He&rsquo;s in love with life,
      puppy-love; his clubs, his theater first-nights, his invitations to big
      houses which he seldom accepts, big people coming to his House with Three
      Eyes. And, of course, his sense of power in the paper. No; he won&rsquo;t
      quit. How could he? He&rsquo;ll compromise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you figure him to be the compromising sort?&rdquo; asked
      Marrineal doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the journalistic Puritan that he lets on to be. Look
      at that Harvey Wheelwright editorial,&rdquo; pointed out the acute Ives.
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t believe what he wrote about Wheelwright; just did it
      for his own purposes. Well, if the oracle can work himself for his own
      purposes, others can work him when the time comes, if it&rsquo;s properly
      managed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal shook his head. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a weakness in him I
      haven&rsquo;t found it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives put on a look of confidential assurance. &ldquo;Be sure it&rsquo;s
      there. Only it isn&rsquo;t of the ordinary kind. Banneker is pretty big in
      his way. No,&rdquo; he pursued thoughtfully; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t women,
      and it isn&rsquo;t Wall Street, and it isn&rsquo;t drink; it isn&rsquo;t
      even money, in the usual sense. But it&rsquo;s something. By the way, did
      I tell you that I&rsquo;d found an acquaintance from the desert where
      Banneker hails from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Marrineal&rsquo;s tone subtly indicated that he should
      have been told at once. That sort of thing was, indeed, the basis on which
      Ives drew a considerable stipend from his patron&rsquo;s private purse, as
      &ldquo;personal representative of Mr. Marrineal&rdquo; for purposes
      unspecified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A railroad man. From what he tells me there was some sort of
      love-affair there. A girl who materialized from nowhere and spent two
      weeks, mostly with the romantic station-agent. Might have been a princess
      in exile, by my informant, who saw her twice. More likely some cheap
      little skate of a movie actress on a bust.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A station-agent&rsquo;s taste in women friends&mdash;&rdquo; began
      Marrineal, and forbore unnecessarily to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly it has improved. Or&mdash;well, at any rate, there was
      something there. My railroad man thinks the affair drove Banneker out of
      his job. The fact of his being woman-proof here points to its having been
      serious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a girl out there about that time visiting Camilla Van
      Arsdale,&rdquo; remarked Marrineal carelessly; &ldquo;a New York girl. One
      of the same general set. Miss Van Arsdale used to be a New Yorker and
      rather a distinguished one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much master of his devious craft to betray discomfiture over another&rsquo;s
      superior knowledge of a subject which he had tried to make his own, Ely
      Ives remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she was probably the real thing. The princess on vacation. You
      don&rsquo;t know who she was, I suppose,&rdquo; he added tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal did not answer, thereby giving his factotum uncomfortably to
      reflect that he really must not expect payment for information and the
      information also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll bear watching.&rdquo; Ives wound up with his
      favorite philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a few days after this that, by a special interposition of kindly
      chance, Ives, having returned from a trip out of town, saw Banneker and Io
      breakfasting in the station restaurant. To Marrineal he said nothing of
      this at the time; nor, indeed, to any one else. But later he took it to a
      very private market of his own, the breakfast-room of a sunny and secluded
      house far uptown, where lived, in an aroma of the domestic virtues, a
      benevolent-looking old gentleman who combined the attributes of the
      ferret, the leech, and the vulture in his capacity as editor of that
      famous weekly publication, The Searchlight. Ives did not sell in that
      mart; he traded for other information. This time he wanted something about
      Judge Willis Enderby, for he was far enough on the inside politically to
      see in him a looming figure which might stand in the way of certain
      projects, unannounced as yet, but tenderly nurtured in the ambitious
      breast of Tertius C. Marrineal. From the gently smiling patriarch he
      received as much of the unwritten records as that authority deemed it
      expedient to give him, together with an admonition, thrown in for good
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous, my young friend! Dangerous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The passionate and patient collector thought it highly probable that
      Willis Enderby would be dangerous game. Certainly he did not intend to
      hunt in those fields, unless he could contrive a weapon of overwhelming
      caliber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ely Ives&rsquo;s analysis of Banneker&rsquo;s situation was in a measure
      responsible for Marrineal&rsquo;s proposition of the new deal to his
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has accepted it,&rdquo; the owner told his purveyor of
      information. &ldquo;But the real fight is to come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the policy of the editorial page,&rdquo; opined Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This is only a truce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As a truce Banneker also regarded it. He had no desire to break it. Nor,
      after it was established, did Marrineal make any overt attempt to
      interfere with his conduct of his column.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awaiting gage of battle from his employer, in vain, Banneker decided
      to leave the issue to chance. Surely he was not surrendering any
      principle, since he continued to write as he chose upon whatever topics he
      selected. Time enough to fight when there should be urged upon him either
      one of the cardinal sins of journalism, the <i>suppressio veri</i> or the
      <i>suggestio falsi</i>, which he had more than once excoriated in other
      papers, to the pious horror of the hush-birds of the craft who had
      chattered and cheeped accusations of &ldquo;fouling one&rsquo;s own nest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Opportunity was not lacking to Marrineal for objections to a policy which
      made powerful enemies for the paper; Banneker, once assured of his
      following, had hit out right and left. From being a weak-kneed and rather
      apologetic defender of the &ldquo;common people,&rdquo; The Patriot had
      become, logically, under Banneker&rsquo;s vigorous and outspoken policy, a
      proponent of the side of labor against capital. It had hotly supported two
      important and righteous local strikes and been the chief agent in winning
      one. With equal fervor it had advocated a third strike whose justice was
      at best dubious and had made itself anathema, though the strike was lost,
      to an industrial group which was honestly striving to live up to honorable
      standards. It had offended a powerful ring of bankers and for a time
      embarrassed Marrineal in his loans. It had threatened editorial reprisals
      upon a combination of those feared and arrogant advertisers, the
      department stores, for endeavoring, with signal lack of success, to
      procure the suppression of certain market news. It became known as
      independent, honest, unafraid, radical (in Wall Street circles &ldquo;socialistic&rdquo;
      or even &ldquo;anarchistic&rdquo;), and, to the profession, as dangerous
      to provoke. Advertisers were, from time to time, alienated; public men,
      often of The Patriot&rsquo;s own trend of thought, opposed. Commercial
      associations even passed resolutions, until Banneker took to publishing
      them with such comment as seemed to him good and appropriate. Marrineal
      uttered no protest, though the unlucky Haring beat his elegantly
      waistcoated breast and uttered profane if subdued threats of resigning,
      which were for effect only; for The Patriot&rsquo;s circulation continued
      to grow and the fact to which every advertising expert clings as to the
      one solid hope in a vaporous calling, is that advertising follows
      circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom did Banneker see his employer in the office, but Marrineal often
      came to the Saturday nights of The House With Three Eyes, which had
      already attained the fame of a local institution. As the numbers drawn to
      it increased, it closed its welcoming orbs earlier and earlier, and, once
      they were darkened, there was admittance only for the chosen few.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a first Saturday in October, New York&rsquo;s homing month for its
      indigenous social birds and butterflies, when The House triply blinked
      itself into darkness at the untimely hour of eleven-forty-five. There was
      the usual heterogeneous crowd there, alike in one particular alone, that
      every guest represented, if not necessarily distinction, at least
      achievement in his own line. Judge Willis Enderby, many times invited, had
      for the first time come. At five minutes after midnight, the incorruptible
      doorkeeper sent an urgent message requesting Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s personal
      attention to a party who declined politely but firmly to be turned away.
      The host, answering the summons, found Io. She held out both hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re glad to see me,&rdquo; she said imperatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light up the three eyes,&rdquo; Banneker ordered the doorman.
      &ldquo;Are you answered?&rdquo; he said to Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very pretty,&rdquo; she approved. &ldquo;It means
      &lsquo;welcome,&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Herbert and Esther can come in, can&rsquo;t they? They&rsquo;re
      waiting in the car for me to be rejected in disgrace. They&rsquo;ve even
      bet on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lose,&rdquo; answered Banneker with finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you forgive me for cajoling your big, black Cerberus, because
      it&rsquo;s my first visit this year, and if I&rsquo;m not nicely treated I&rsquo;ll
      never come again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your welcome includes full amnesty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ll let me have one of my hands back&mdash;it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter which one, really&mdash;I&rsquo;ll signal the others
      to come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, accordingly, she did. Banneker greeted Esther Forbes and Cressey,
      and waited for the trio until they came down. There was a stir as they
      entered. There was usually a stir in any room which Io entered. She had
      that quality of sending waves across the most placid of social pools.
      Willis Enderby was one of the first to greet her, a quick irradiation of
      pleasure relieving the austere beauty of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the castle was closed,&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;How did
      you cross the inviolable barriers?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the magic password,&rdquo; smiled Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youth? Beauty? Or just audacity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honor is pleased to flatter,&rdquo; she returned, drooping her
      eyes at him with a purposefully artificial effect. From the time when she
      was a child of four she had carried on a violent and highly appreciated
      flirtation with &ldquo;Cousin Billy,&rdquo; being the only person in the
      world who employed the diminutive of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Banneker before? But, of course. Everybody knows Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it! He never makes an
      effort, I&rsquo;m told. People just come to him. Where did you meet him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enderby told her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re allies, in a way. Though sometimes he
      is against us. He&rsquo;s doing yeoman work in this reform mayoralty
      campaign. If we elect Robert Laird, as I think we shall, it will be
      chiefly due to The Patriot&rsquo;s editorials.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have confidence in Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;in a way, I have,&rdquo; he returned hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with reservations,&rdquo; she interpreted. &ldquo;What are
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, only, but a big one. The Patriot itself. You see, Io, The
      Patriot is another matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it another matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s Marrineal, for example.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Mr. Marrineal. Evidently you don&rsquo;t trust
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust nobody,&rdquo; disclosed the lawyer, a little sternly,
      &ldquo;who is represented by what The Patriot is and does, whether it be
      Marrineal, Banneker, or another.&rdquo; His glance, wandering about the
      room, fell on Russell Edmonds, seated in a corner talking with the Great
      Gaines. &ldquo;Unless it be Edmonds over there,&rdquo; he qualified.
      &ldquo;All his life he has fought me as a corporation lawyer; yet I have
      the queer feeling that I could trust the inmost secret of my life to his
      honor. Probably I&rsquo;m an old fool, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io devoted a moment&rsquo;s study to the lined and worn face of the
      veteran. &ldquo;No. I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any case, he isn&rsquo;t responsible for The Patriot. He can&rsquo;t
      help it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so cryptic, Cousin Billy. Can&rsquo;t help what?
      What is wrong with the paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to understand,&rdquo; said imperious Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a basis to understanding, you&rsquo;d have to read the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. Everyday. All of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick, reckoning look which she sustained with a slight
      deepening of color. &ldquo;The advertisements, too?&rdquo; She nodded.
      &ldquo;What do you think of them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them are too disgusting to discuss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it occur to you to compare them with the lofty standards of our
      young friend&rsquo;s editorials?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he to do with the advertisements?&rdquo; she countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assume, for the sake of the argument, that he has nothing to do
      with them. You may have noticed a recent editorial against race-track
      gambling, with the suicide of a young bank messenger who had robbed his
      employer to pay his losses as text.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Surely that kind of editorial makes for good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being counsel for that bank, I happen to know the circumstances of
      the suicide. The boy had pinned his faith to one of the race-track
      tipsters who advertise in The Patriot to furnish a list of sure winners
      for so much a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that Mr. Banneker knew that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not. But he knows that his paper takes money for
      publishing those vicious advertisements.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he couldn&rsquo;t help it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably he can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what would you have him do? Stop writing the editorials? I
      think it is evidence of his courage that he should dare to attack the
      evils which his own paper fosters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one view of it, certainly,&rdquo; replied Enderby
      dryly. &ldquo;A convenient view. But there are other details. Banneker is
      an ardent advocate of abstinence, &lsquo;Down with the Demon Rum!&rsquo;
      The columns of The Patriot reek with whiskey ads. The same with tobacco.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Cousin Billy, you don&rsquo;t believe that a newspaper should
      shut out liquor and tobacco advertisements, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer smiled patiently. &ldquo;Come back on the track, Io,&rdquo; he
      invited. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point. If a newspaper preaches the
      harm in these habits, it shouldn&rsquo;t accept money for exploiting them.
      Look further. What of the loan-shark offers, and the blue-sky stock
      propositions, and the damnable promises of the consumption and cancer
      quacks? You can&rsquo;t turn a page of The Patriot without stumbling on
      them. There&rsquo;s a smell of death about that money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all the newspapers publish the same kind of
      advertisements?&rdquo; argued the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Some won&rsquo;t publish an advertisement without
      being satisfied of its good faith. Others discriminate less carefully. But
      there are few as bad as The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Banneker were your client, would you advise him to resign?&rdquo;
      she asked shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enderby winced and chuckled simultaneously. &ldquo;Probably not. It is
      doubtful whether he could find another rostrum of equal influence. And his
      influence is mainly for good. But since you seem to be interested in
      newspapers, Io&rdquo;&mdash;he gave her another of his keen glances&mdash;&ldquo;from
      The Patriot you can make a diagnosis of the disease from which modern
      journalism is suffering. A deep-seated, pervasive insincerity. At its
      worst, it is open, shameless hypocrisy. The public feels it, but is too
      lacking in analytical sense to comprehend it. Hence the unformulated,
      instinctive, universal distrust of the press. &lsquo;I never believe
      anything I read in the papers.&rsquo; Of course, that is both false and
      silly. But the feeling is there; and it has to be reckoned with one day.
      From this arises an injustice, that the few papers which are really
      upright, honest, and faithful to their own standards, are tainted in the
      public mind with the double-dealing of the others. Such as The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You use The Patriot for your purposes,&rdquo; Io pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it stands for what I believe right. I only wish I could trust
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>really</i> feel that you can&rsquo;t trust Mr.
      Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; we&rsquo;re back to that!&rdquo; thought Enderby with
      uneasiness. Aloud he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very pretty problem whether
      a writer who shares the profits of a hypocritical and dishonest policy can
      maintain his own professional independence and virtue. I gravely doubt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Io, and there was pride in her avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Judge gravely, &ldquo;what does it all
      mean? Are you letting yourself become interested in Errol Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io raised clear and steady eyes to the concerned regard of her old friend.
      &ldquo;If I ever marry again, I shall marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to divorce poor Delavan?&rdquo; asked the
      other quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall play the game through,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a space Willis Enderby sat thinking. &ldquo;Does Banneker know your&mdash;your
      intentions?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t let him, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t know the intention. He may know the&mdash;the
      feeling back of it.&rdquo; A slow and glorious flush rose in her face,
      making her eyes starry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can keep it from
      him, Cousin Billy. I don&rsquo;t even know that I want to. I&rsquo;m an
      honest sort of idiot, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant that he may prove as honest!&rdquo; he half whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Banneker, bearing a glass of champagne and some pâté sandwiches
      for Io, supplanted the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the devotee of toil that common report believes, Ban?&rdquo;
      she asked him lazily. &ldquo;They say that you write editorials with one
      hand and welcome your guests with the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;To-night I&rsquo;m not
      thinking of work. I&rsquo;m not thinking of anything but you. It&rsquo;s
      very wonderful, your being here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you to think of work. I want to see you in the very act.
      Won&rsquo;t you write an editorial for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;This late? That would be cruelty to my
      secretary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it down for you. I&rsquo;m fairly fast on the
      typewriter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me the subject, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than fair,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;What shall it be? It
      ought to be something with memories in it. Books? Poetry?&rdquo; she
      groped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! Your oldest, favorite book. Have you
      forgotten?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sears-Roebuck catalogue? I get a copy every season, to renew
      the old thrill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a romanticist you are!&rdquo; said she softly. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
      you write an editorial about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I? Try me. Come up to the den.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to the remote austerities of the work-room. From a shelf he
      took down the fat, ornate pamphlet, now much increased in bulk over its
      prototype of the earlier years. With random finger he parted the leaves,
      here, there, again and still again, seeking auguries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, I shut my eyes&mdash;and we&rsquo;re
      in the shack again&mdash;the clean air of desert spaces&mdash;the click of
      the transmitter in the office that I won&rsquo;t answer, being more
      importantly engaged&mdash;the faint fragrance of <i>you</i> permeating
      everything&mdash;youth&mdash;the unknown splendor of life&mdash;Now! Go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that editorial, composed upon the unpromising theme of mail-order
      merchandising, the Great Gaines afterward said that it was a kaleidoscopic
      panorama set moving to the harmonic undertones of a song of winds and
      waters, of passion and the inner meanings of life, as if Shelley had
      rhapsodized a catalogue into poetic being and glorious significance. He
      said it was foolish to edit a magazine when one couldn&rsquo;t trust a
      cheap newspaper not to come flaming forth into literature which turned one&rsquo;s
      most conscientious and aspiring efforts into tinsel. He also said &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io Welland (for it was Io Welland and not Io Eyre whom the soothsayer saw
      before him as he declaimed), instrument and inspiration of the
      achievement, said no word of direct praise. But as she wrote, her fingers
      felt as if they were dripping electric sparks. When, at the close, he
      asked, quite humbly, &ldquo;Is that what you wanted?&rdquo; she caught her
      breath on something like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a title,&rdquo; she said, recovering herself.
      &ldquo;Call it &lsquo;If there were Dreams to Sell.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My readers won&rsquo;t
      get it. Pinheads! They get nothing that isn&rsquo;t plain as the nose on
      their silly faces. Never mind. It&rsquo;s good for &rsquo;em to be puzzled
      once in a while. Teaches &rsquo;em their place.... I&rsquo;ll tell you who
      will understand it, though,&rdquo; he continued, and laughed queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the people who really matter will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some who matter a lot to The Patriot will. The local merchants who
      advertise with us. They&rsquo;ll be wild.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hate the mail-order houses with a deadly fear, because the
      cataloguers undersell them in a lot of lines. Won&rsquo;t Rome howl the
      day after this appears!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the relation between advertising and policy, Ban,&rdquo;
      invited Io, and summarized Willis Enderby&rsquo;s views.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had formulated for his own use and comfort the fallacy which has
      since become standard for all journalists unwilling or unable to face the
      issue of their own responsibility to the public. He now gave it forth
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A newspaper, Io, is like a billboard. Any one has a right to hire
      it for purposes of exploiting and selling whatever he has to sell. In
      accepting the advertisement, provided it is legal and decent, the
      publisher accepts no more responsibility than the owner of the land on
      which a billboard stands. Advertising space is a free forum.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when it affects the editorial attitude&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the test,&rdquo; he put in quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      why I&rsquo;m glad to print this editorial of ours. It&rsquo;s a
      declaration of independence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she acquiesced eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I use the power of my editorials for any cause that I don&rsquo;t
      believe in&mdash;yes, or for my own advantage or the advantage of my
      employer&mdash;that will be the beginning of surrender. But as long as I
      keep a free pen and speak as I believe for what I hold as right and
      against what I hold as wrong, I can afford to leave the advertising policy
      to those who control it. It isn&rsquo;t my responsibility.... It&rsquo;s
      an omen, Io; I was waiting for it. Marrineal and I are at a deadlock on
      the question of my control of the editorial page. This ought to furnish a
      fighting issue. I&rsquo;m glad it came from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but if it&rsquo;s going to make trouble for you, I shall be
      sorry. And I was going to propose that we write one every Saturday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Does that mean&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that I shall become a regular attendant at Mr. Errol
      Banneker&rsquo;s famous Saturday nights. Don&rsquo;t ask me what more it
      means.&rdquo; She rose and delivered the typed sheets into his hands.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, myself. Take me back to the others,
      Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Banneker, wakened next morning to a life of new vigor and sweetness,
      the outcome of the mail-order editorial was worth not one troubled
      thought. All his mind was centered on Io.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Explosions of a powerful and resonant nature followed the publication of
      the fantastic, imaginative, and delightful mail-order catalogue editorial.
      In none of these senses, except the first, did it appeal to the
      advertising managers of the various department stores. They looked upon it
      as an outrage, an affront, a deliberate slap in the face for an
      established, vested, and prodigal support of the newspaper press. What the
      devil did The Patriot mean by it; The Patriot which sorely needed just
      their class of reputable patronage, and, after sundry contortions of
      rate-cutting, truckling, and offers of news items to back the advertising,
      was beginning to get it? They asked themselves, and, failing of any
      satisfactory answer, they asked The Patriot in no uncertain terms.
      Receiving vague and pained replies, they even went to the length of
      holding a meeting and sending a committee to wait upon the desperate
      Haring, passing over the advertising manager who was a mere figurehead in
      The Patriot office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began one of those scenes of bullying and browbeating to which every
      newspaper, not at once powerful and honest enough to command the fear and
      respect of its advertisers, is at some time subjected. Haring, the victim
      personifying the offending organ, was stretched upon the rack and put to
      the question. What explanation had he to offer of The Patriot&rsquo;s
      breach of faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had none, had the miserable business manager. No one could regret it
      more than he. But, really, gentlemen, to call it a breach of faith&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What else was it? Wasn&rsquo;t the paper turning on its own advertisers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well; in a sense. But not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing! Wasn&rsquo;t it trying to undermine their legitimate
      business?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not intentionally, Mr. Haring was (piteously) sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intentionally be damned! Did he expect to carry their advertising on one
      page and ruin their business on another? Did he think they were putting
      money into The Patriot&mdash;a doubtful medium for their business, at best&mdash;to
      cut their own throats? They&rsquo;d put it to him reasonably, now; who,
      after all, paid for the getting out of The Patriot? Wasn&rsquo;t it the
      advertisers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, certainly, gentlemen. Granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the paper run a month, a fortnight, a week without advertising?
    </p>
    <p>
      No; no! It couldn&rsquo;t. No newspaper could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then if the advertisers paid the paper&rsquo;s way, weren&rsquo;t they
      entitled to some say about it? Didn&rsquo;t it have a right to give
      &rsquo;em at least a fair show?
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, gentlemen, if he, Haring, were in control of the paper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, why; why the <i>hell</i> was a cub of an editor allowed to cut loose
      and jump their game that way? They could find other places to spend their
      money; yes, and get a better return for it. They&rsquo;d see The Patriot,
      and so on, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haring understood their feelings, sympathized, even shared them.
      Unfortunately the editorial page was quite out of his province.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose province was it, then? Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s, eh? And to whom was Mr.
      Banneker responsible? Mr. Marrineal, alone? All right! They would see Mr.
      Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haring was sorry, but Mr. Marrineal was out of town. (Fiction.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in that case, Banneker. They&rsquo;d trust themselves to show him
      which foot he got off on. They&rsquo;d teach (two of them, in their stress
      of emotion, said &ldquo;learn&rdquo;; they were performing this in chorus)
      Banneker&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Mr. Banneker wasn&rsquo;t there, either. (Haring, very terrified, and
      having built up an early conception of the Wild West Banneker from the
      clean-up of the dock gang, beheld in his imagination dejected members of
      the committee issuing piecemeal from the doors and windows of the
      editorial office, the process being followed by an even more regrettable
      exodus of advertising from the pages of The Patriot.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Striving to be at once explanatory and propitiatory to all and sundry,
      Haring was reduced to inarticulate, choking interjections and paralytic
      motions of the hands, when a member of the delegation, hitherto silent,
      spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the representative of McLean &amp; Swazey, a college graduate of a
      type then new, though now much commoner, in the developing profession of
      advertising. He had read the peccant editorial with a genuine relish of
      its charm and skill, and had justly estimated it for what it was, an
      intellectual <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>, the expression of a passing fancy
      for a tempting subject, not of a policy to be further pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough has been said, I think, to define our position,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;All that we need is some assurance that Mr. Banneker&rsquo;s
      wit and skill will not be turned again to the profit of our competitors
      who, by the way, do <i>not</i> advertise in The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Haring eagerly gave the assurance. He would have given assurance of
      Banneker&rsquo;s head on a salver to be rid of these persecuting
      autocrats. They withdrew, leaving behind an atmosphere of threat and
      disaster, dark, inglorious clouds of which Haring trailed behind him when
      he entered the office of the owner with his countenance of woe. His
      postulate was that Mr. Marrineal should go to his marplot editor and duly
      to him lay down the law; no more offending of the valuable
      department-store advertisers. No; nor of any others. Or he, Haring
      (greatly daring), would do it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the sweating and agonizing business manager, Marrineal looked very
      cool and tolerant and mildly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did that, Mr. Haring, do you appreciate what the result
      would be? We should have another editorial worse than the first, as soon
      as Mr. Banneker could think it out. No; you leave this to me. I&rsquo;ll
      manage it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His management took the negative form of a profound silence upon the
      explicit point. But on the following morning Banneker found upon his desk
      a complete analytical table showing the advertising revenue of the paper
      by classes, with a star over the department-store list, indicating a dated
      withdrawal of twenty-two thousand dollars a year. The date was of that
      day. Thus was Banneker enabled to figure out, by a simple process, the
      loss to himself of any class of advertising, or even small group in a
      class, dropping out of the paper. It was clever of Marrineal, he admitted
      to himself, and, in a way, disappointing. His proffered gage of battle had
      been refused, almost ignored. The issue was not to be joined when he was
      ready, but when Marrineal was ready, and on Marrineal&rsquo;s own ground.
      Very well, Banneker could be a good waiter. Meantime he had at least
      asserted his independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io called him up by &lsquo;phone, avid of news of the editorial, and he
      was permitted to take her to luncheon and tell her all about it. In her
      opinion he had won a victory; established a position. Banneker was far
      less sanguine; he had come to entertain a considerable respect for
      Marrineal&rsquo;s capacity. And he had another and more immediate
      complication on his mind, which fact his companion, by some occult
      exercise of divination, perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is worrying you, Ban?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker did not want to talk about that. He wanted to talk about Io,
      about themselves. He said so. She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just the usual complications. There&rsquo;s nothing to interest
      you in them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; she maintained ardently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker caught his breath. Had she given him her lips, it could hardly
      have meant more&mdash;perhaps not meant so much as this tranquil
      assumption of her right to share in the major concerns of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been reading the paper,&rdquo; he began, and waited
      for her silent nod before going on, &ldquo;you know our attitude toward
      organized labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are for it when it is right and not always against it when
      it is wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t split hairs in a matter of editorial policy. I&rsquo;ve
      made The Patriot practically the mouthpiece of labor in this city; much
      more so than the official organ, which has no influence and a small
      following. Just now I&rsquo;m specially anxious to hold them in line for
      the mayoralty campaign. We&rsquo;ve got to elect Robert Laird. Otherwise
      we&rsquo;ll have such an orgy of graft and rottenness as the city has
      never seen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the labor element for Laird?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t against him, except that he is naturally regarded as
      a silk-stocking. The difficulty isn&rsquo;t politics. There&rsquo;s some
      new influence in local labor circles that is working against me; against
      The Patriot. I think it&rsquo;s a fellow named McClintick, a new man from
      the West.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he wants to be bought off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of the old style of labor leader,&rdquo;
      returned Banneker. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as simple as that. No; from what
      I hear, he&rsquo;s a fanatic. And he has great influence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get hold of him and talk it out with him,&rdquo; advised Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to.&rdquo; He brooded for a moment. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
      a man in New York,&rdquo; he said fretfully, &ldquo;that has stood for the
      interests of the masses and against the power of money as I have. Why, Io,
      before we cut loose in The Patriot, a banker or a railroad president was
      sacrosanct. His words were received with awe. Wall Street was the holy of
      holies, not to be profaned by the slightest hint of impiety. Well, we&rsquo;ve
      changed all that! Not I, alone. Our cartoons have done more than the
      editorials. Every other paper in town has had to follow our lead. Even The
      Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like The Ledger,&rdquo; declared Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It has a sort of dignity; the dignity of
      self-respect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t The Patriot?&rdquo; demanded the jealous Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; she answered frankly, &ldquo;except for your
      editorials. They have the dignity of good workmanship, and honesty, and
      courage, even when you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we so often wrong, Io?&rdquo; he said wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear boy, you can&rsquo;t expect a girl, brought up as I have been,
      to believe that society is upside down, and would be better if it were
      tipped over the other way and run by a lot of hod-carriers and
      ditch-diggers and cooks. Can you, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Nor is that what I advocate. I&rsquo;m for the under
      dog. For fair play. So are you, aren&rsquo;t you? I saw your name on the
      Committee List of the Consumers&rsquo; League, dealing with conditions in
      the department stores.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Those girls haven&rsquo;t
      a chance in some of the shops. They&rsquo;re brutalized. The stores don&rsquo;t
      even pretend to obey the laws. We are trying to work out some sort of
      organization, now, for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;re hostile to organized labor! Who shall ever
      understand the feminine mind! Some day you&rsquo;ll be coming to us for
      help.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. It must be a curious sensation, Ban, to have the
      consciousness of the power that you wield, and to be responsible to nobody
      on earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the public that reads us,&rdquo; he corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a real responsibility. There is no authority over you; no
      appeal from your judgments. Hasn&rsquo;t that something to do with people&rsquo;s
      dislike and distrust of the newspapers; the sense that so much
      irresponsible power is wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;any kind of censorship is worse than
      the evil it remedies. I&rsquo;ve never shown you my creed, have I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was half jocular; there was a smile on his lips, but his eyes
      seemed to look beyond the petty troubles and problems of his craft to a
      final and firm verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his watch out and opened the back. For a moment she thought, with
      confused emotions, that she would see there a picture of herself of which
      he might have possessed himself somewhere. She closed her eyes momentarily
      against the fear of that anti-climax. When she opened them, it was to
      read, in a clear, fine print those high and sure words of Milton&rsquo;s
      noblest message:
    </p>
    <p>
      And though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the
      earth, so truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by licensing and
      prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and falsehood grapple; who
      ever knew truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter? Her
      confuting is the best and surest suppressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice she read the pregnant message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said she gravely. &ldquo;To keep&mdash;for
      always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll put it at the head of The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ready. I want to be surer; absolutely sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she declared superbly; &ldquo;of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me sure of myself, Io. But there&rsquo;s Marrineal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s Marrineal. You must have a paper of your own,
      mustn&rsquo;t you, Ban, eventually?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. If I ever get enough money to own it absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only four years ago,&rdquo; she murmured, with apparent
      irrelevancy. &ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; he asked anxiously as she rose.
      &ldquo;Are you coming Saturday night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the agency of Russell Edmonds, McClintick, the labor leader, came
      to see Banneker. He was a stooping giant with a deep, melancholy voice,
      and his attitude toward The Patriot was one of distrustful reticence.
      Genuine ardor has, however, a warming influence. McClintick&rsquo;s
      silence melted by degrees, not into confidence but, surprisingly, into
      indignation, directed upon all the &ldquo;capitalistic press&rdquo; in
      general, but in particular against The Patriot. Why single out The
      Patriot, specially, Banneker asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hypocrite,&rdquo; muttered the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the reason came out, under pressure: The Patriot had been (in
      the words of the labor man) making a big row over the arrest of certain
      labor organizers, in one of the recurrent outbreaks against the Steel
      Trust, opposed by that organization&rsquo;s systematic and tyrannous
      method of oppression. So far, so good. But why hadn&rsquo;t the paper said
      a word about the murder of strikers&rsquo; wives and children out at the
      Veridian Lumber Company&rsquo;s mills in Oregon; an outrage far surpassing
      anything ever laid to the account of the Steel Trust? Simple reason,
      answered Banneker; there had been no news of it over the wires. No; of
      course there hadn&rsquo;t. The Amalgamated Wire Association (another tool
      of capitalism) had suppressed it; wouldn&rsquo;t let any strike stuff get
      on the wires that it could keep off. Then how, asked Banneker, could it be
      expected&mdash;? McClintick interrupted in his voice of controlled
      passion; had Mr. Banneker ever heard of the Chicago Transcript (naming the
      leading morning paper); had he ever read it? Well, The Transcript&mdash;which,
      he, McClintick, hated strongly as an organ of money&mdash;nevertheless did
      honestly gather and publish news, as he was constrained huskily to admit.
      It had the Veridian story; was still running it from time to time.
      Therefore, if Mr. Banneker was interested, on behalf of The Patriot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, The Patriot was interested; would obtain and publish the story
      in full, if it was as Mr. McClintick represented, with due editorial
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it?&rdquo; grumbled McClintick, gave his hat a look of mingled
      hope and skepticism, put it on, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s wrong with that chap&rsquo;s mental digestion?&rdquo;
      Banneker inquired of Edmonds, who had sat quiet throughout the interview.
      &ldquo;What is he holding back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; returned the veteran in a tone which might have
      served for echo of the labor man&rsquo;s gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the Veridian story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve just checked it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the milk in that cocoanut?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sour!&rdquo; said Edmonds with such energy that Banneker turned to
      look at him direct. &ldquo;The principal owner of Veridian is named
      Marrineal.... Where you going, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see the principal owner of the name,&rdquo; said Banneker
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quest took him to the big house on upper Fifth Avenue. Marrineal heard
      his editorial writer with impassive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the story has got here,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you own Veridian?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope rose within Banneker. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother does. She&rsquo;s in Europe. A rather innocent old
      person. The innocence of age, perhaps. Quite old.&rdquo; All of this in a
      perfectly tranquil voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen The Chicago Transcript? It&rsquo;s an ugly story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. I&rsquo;ve sent a man out to the camp. There won&rsquo;t be
      any more shootings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes rather late. I&rsquo;ve told McClintick, the labor man who
      comes from Wyoming, that we&rsquo;ll carry the story, if we verify it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal raised his eyes slowly to Banneker&rsquo;s stern face. &ldquo;Have
      you?&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Now, as to the mayoralty campaign; what
      do you think of running a page feature of Laird&rsquo;s reforms, as
      President of the Board, tracing each one down to its effect and showing
      what any backward step would mean? By the way, Laird is going to be pretty
      heavily obligated to The Patriot if he&rsquo;s elected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour they talked politics, nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office Edmonds was making a dossier of the Veridian reports. It was
      ready when Banneker returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it wait,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prudence ordained that he should throw the troublous stuff into the
      waste-basket. He wondered if he was becoming prudent, as another man might
      wonder whether he was becoming old. At any rate, he would make no decision
      until he had talked it over with Io. Not only did he feel instinctive
      confidence in her sense of fair play; but also this relationship of
      interest in his affairs, established by her, was the opportunity of his
      closest approach; an intimacy of spirit assured and subtle. He hoped that
      she would come early on Saturday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not. Some dinner party had claimed her, and it was after
      eleven when she arrived with Archie Densmore. At once Banneker took her
      aside and laid before her the whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ban!&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so simple,
      having power to play with, is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I to handle this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mills belong to Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s mother, you said?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically they do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is&mdash;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A silly and vain old fool.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that his opinion of her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessarily. But he&rsquo;s fond of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he really try to remedy conditions, do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. So far as that goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d drop it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print nothing at all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I expected from you. Why do you advise it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loyalty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paralytic virtue,&rdquo; said Banneker with such bitterness of
      conviction that Io answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t mean that to be simply clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a measure of truth in it. But, Ban, you can&rsquo;t
      use Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s own paper to expose conditions in Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s
      mother&rsquo;s mills. If he&rsquo;d even directed you to hold off&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his infernal cleverness. I&rsquo;d have told him to go
      to the devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And resigned?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can resign now,&rdquo; she pointed out. &ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;d
      be foolish. You can do such big things. You <i>are</i> doing such big
      things with The Patriot. Cousin Billy Enderby says that if Laird is
      elected it will be your doing. Where else could you find such opportunity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this, Io,&rdquo; he said, after a moment of heavy-browed
      brooding very unlike his usual blithe certainty of bearing. &ldquo;Suppose
      that lumber property were my own, and this thing had broken out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say to print it, every word,&rdquo; she answered
      promptly. &ldquo;Or&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke very slowly and with a tremor
      of color flickering in her cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;if it were mine, I&rsquo;d
      tell you to print it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a transfigured face. His hand fell on hers, in the
      covert of the little shelter of plants behind which they sat. &ldquo;Do
      you realize what that implies?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; she answered in her clear undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over to her hand, which turned, soft palm up, to meet his lips.
      She whispered a warning and he raised his head quickly. Ely Ives had
      passed near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrineal&rsquo;s familiar,&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;I wonder
      how he got here. Certainly I didn&rsquo;t ask him.... Very well, Io. I&rsquo;ll
      compromise. But ... I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll put that quotation from
      the Areopagitica at the head of my column. That will have to wait. Perhaps
      it will have to wait until I&mdash;we get a paper of our own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ban!&rdquo; whispered Io.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once a month Marrineal gave a bachelor dinner of Lucullan repute. The
      company, though much smaller than the gatherings at The House With Three
      Eyes, covered a broader and looser social range. Having declined several
      of his employer&rsquo;s invitations in succession on the well-justified
      plea of work, Banneker felt it incumbent upon him to attend one of these
      events, and accordingly found himself in a private dining-room of the
      choicest of restaurants, tabled with a curiously assorted group of
      financiers, editors, actors, a small selection of the more raffish members
      of The Retreat including Delavan Eyre; Ely Ives; an elderly Jewish lawyer
      of unsavory reputation, enormous income, and real and delicate
      scholarship; Herbert Cressey, a pair of the season&rsquo;s racing-kings,
      an eminent art connoisseur, and a smattering of men-about-town. Seated
      between the lawyer and one of the racing-men, Banneker, as the dinner
      progressed, found himself watching Delavan Eyre, opposite, who was
      drinking with sustained intensity, but without apparent effect upon his
      debonair bearing. Banneker thought to read a haunting fear in his eyes,
      and was cogitating upon what it might portend, when his attention was
      distracted by Ely Ives, who had been requested (as he announced) to
      exhibit his small skill at some minor sleight-of-hand tricks. The skill,
      far from justifying its possessor&rsquo;s modest estimate, was so unusual
      as to provoke expressions of admiration from Mr. Stecklin, the lawyer on
      Banneker&rsquo;s right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; hypnotism too,&rdquo; said Ely Ives briskly, after twenty
      minutes of legerdemain. &ldquo;Child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, who suggested hypnotism?&rdquo; murmured Stecklin in his
      limpid and confidential undertone, close to Banneker&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;You?
      I? No! No one, <i>I</i> think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Banneker thought, and was the more interested in Ives&rsquo;s
      procedure. Though the drinking had been heavy at his end of the table, he
      seemed quite unaffected, was now tripping from man to man, peering into
      the eyes of each, &ldquo;to find an appropriate subject,&rdquo; as he
      said. Delavan Eyre roused himself out of a semi-torpor as the wiry little
      prowler stared down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the special idea?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a bit of mesmerism,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      try you for a subject. If you&rsquo;ll stand up, feet apart, eyes closed,
      I&rsquo;ll hypnotize you so that you&rsquo;ll fall over at a movement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; retorted Eyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a bet,&rdquo; Ives came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double it if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on.&rdquo; Eyre, slowly swallowing the last of a
      brandy-and-soda, rose, reaching into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessary, between gentlemen,&rdquo; said Ely Ives with a
      gesture just a little too suave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; muttered the lawyer at Banneker&rsquo;s side.
      &ldquo;Between gentlemen. Eck-xactly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuant to instructions, Eyre stood with his feet a few inches apart and
      his eyes closed. &ldquo;At the word, you bring your heels together. Click!
      And you keep your balance. If you can. For the two hundred. Any one else
      want in?... No?... Ready, Mr. Eyre. Now! <i>Hep</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The heels clicked, but with a stuttering, weak impact. Eyre, bulky and
      powerful, staggered, toppled to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up there!&rdquo; His neighbor propped him, and was clutched in
      his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; said Eyre thickly. &ldquo;Sorry, Banks! Let me
      try that again. Oh, the bet&rsquo;s yours, Mr. Ives,&rdquo; he added, as
      that keen gambler began to enter a protest. &ldquo;Send you a check in the
      morning&mdash;if that&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Cressey, hand in pocket, was at his side instantly. &ldquo;Pay him
      now, Del,&rdquo; he said in a tone which did not conceal his contemptuous
      estimate of Ives. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s money, if you haven&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no! A check will be <i>quite</i> all right,&rdquo; protested
      Ives. &ldquo;At your convenience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Others gathered about, curious and interested. Banneker, puzzled by a
      vague suspicion which he sought to formulate, was aware of a low runnel of
      commentary at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very curious. Shrewd; yes. A clever fellow.... Sad, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad?&rdquo; He turned sharply on the lawyer of unsavory suits.
      &ldquo;What is sad about it? A fool and his money! Is that tragedy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comedy, my friend. Always comedy. This also, perhaps. But grim....
      Our friend there who is so clever of hand and eye; he is not perhaps a
      medical man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is. What connection&mdash;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, as a
      flood of memory suddenly poured light upon a dark spot in some of his
      forgotten reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? You know? Yes; I have had such a case in my legal practice.
      Died of an&mdash;an error. He made a mistake&mdash;in a bottle, which he
      purchased for that purpose. But this one&mdash;he elects to live and face
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously. One can see the dread in his eyes. Some of his friends
      know it&mdash;and his family, I am told. But he does not know this
      interesting little experiment of our friend. Profitable, too, eh? One
      wonders how he came to suspect. A medical man, though; a keen eye. Of
      course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn him,&rdquo; said Banneker quietly. &ldquo;General paralysis?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eck-xactly. Twelve, maybe fifteen years ago, a little recklessness.
      A little overheating of the blood. Perhaps after a dinner like this. The
      poison lies dormant; a snake asleep. Harms no one. Not himself; not
      another. Until&mdash;something here&rdquo;&mdash;he tapped the thick black
      curls over the base of his brain. &ldquo;All that ruddy strength, that
      lusty good-humor passing on courageously&mdash;for he is a brave man, Eyre&mdash;to
      slow torture and&mdash;and the end. Grim, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker reached for a drink. &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that, he is very strong. It might be slow. One prays not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, that little reptile, Ives, shan&rsquo;t have his
      profit of it.&rdquo; Banneker rose and, disdaining even the diplomacy of
      an excuse, drew Ely Ives aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bet of yours was a joke, Ives,&rdquo; he prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives studied him in silence, wishing that he had watched, through the
      dinner, how much drink he took.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A joke?&rdquo; he asked coolly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; advised Banneker with earnestness. &ldquo;I happen to
      have read that luetic diagnosis, myself. A joke, Ives, so far as the two
      hundred goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tear up the check, when it comes. Make what explanation your
      ingenuity can devise. That&rsquo;s your affair. But don&rsquo;t cash that
      check, Ives. For if you do&mdash;I dislike to threaten&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to threaten me, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo;
      interrupted Ives eagerly. &ldquo;If you think it wasn&rsquo;t a fair bet,
      your word is enough for me. That goes. It&rsquo;s off. I think just that
      of you. I&rsquo;m a friend of yours, as I hope to prove to you some day. I
      don&rsquo;t lay this up against you; not for a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not trusting himself to make answer to this proffer, Banneker turned away
      to find his host and make his adieus. As he left, he saw Delavan Eyre,
      flushed but composed, sipping a liqueur and listening with courteous
      appearance of appreciation to a vapid and slobbering story of one of the
      racing magnates. A debauchee, a cumberer of the earth, useless, selfish,
      scandalous of life&mdash;and Banneker, looking at him with pitiful eyes,
      paid his unstinted tribute to the calm and high courage of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking slowly home in the cool air, Banneker gave thanks for a
      drink-proof head. He had need of it; he wanted to think and think clearly.
      How did this shocking revelation about Eyre affect his own hopes of Io?
      That she would stand by her husband through his ordeal Banneker never
      doubted for an instant. Her pride of fair play would compel her to that.
      It came to his mind that this was her other and secret reason for not
      divorcing Eyre; for maintaining still the outward form of a marriage which
      had ceased to exist long before. For a lesser woman, he realized with a
      thrill, it would have been a reason for divorcing him.... Well, here was a
      barrier, indeed, against which he was helpless. Opposed by a loyalty such
      as Io&rsquo;s he could only be silent and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next few weeks she was very good to him. Not only did she lunch
      with him several times, but she came to the Saturday nights of The House
      With Three Eyes, sometimes with Archie Densmore alone, more often with a
      group of her own set, after a dinner or a theater party. Always she made
      opportunity for a little talk apart with her host; talks which any one
      might have heard, for they were concerned almost exclusively with the
      affairs of The Patriot, especially in its relation to the mayoralty
      campaign now coming to a close. Yet, impersonal though the discussions
      might be, Banneker took from them a sense of ever-increasing intimacy and
      communion, if it were only from a sudden, betraying quiver in her voice,
      an involuntary, unconscious look from the shadowed eyes. Whatever of
      resentment he had cherished for her earlier desertion was now dissipated;
      he was wholly hers, content, despite all his passionate longing for her,
      with what she chose to give. In her own time she would be generous, as she
      was brave and honorable....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was warmly interested in the election of Robert Laird to the
      mayoralty, partly because she knew him personally, partly because the
      younger element of society had rather &ldquo;gone in for politics&rdquo;
      that year, on the reform side. Banneker had to admit to her, as the day
      drew close, that the issue was doubtful. Though The Patriot&rsquo;s fervid
      support had been a great asset to the cause, it was now, for the moment, a
      liability to the extent that it was being fiercely denounced in the
      Socialist organ, The Summons, as treasonable to the interests of the
      working-classes. The Summons charged hypocrisy, citing the case of the
      Veridian strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is McClintick?&rdquo; asked Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s back of it, naturally. But The Summons has been waiting
      its chance. Jealous of our influence in the field it&rsquo;s trying to
      cultivate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McClintick is right,&rdquo; remarked Io thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker laughed. &ldquo;Oh, Io! It&rsquo;s such a relief to get a clear
      view and an honest one from some one else. There&rsquo;s no one in the
      office except Russell Edmonds, and he&rsquo;s away now.... You think
      McClintick is right? So do I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so are you. You had to do as you did about the story. If any
      one is to blame, it is Mr. Marrineal. Yet how can one blame him? He had to
      protect his mother. It&rsquo;s a fearfully complicated phenomenon, a
      newspaper, isn&rsquo;t it, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io, the soul of man is simple and clear compared with the soul of a
      newspaper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it has a soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it has. It&rsquo;s got to have. Otherwise what is it but
      a machine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is The Patriot&rsquo;s; yours or Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s? I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
      said Io quaintly, &ldquo;quite see them coalescing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Marrineal has a soul,&rdquo; mused Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t one of his own, let him keep his hands off
      yours!&rdquo; said Io in a flash of feminine jealousy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      done enough already with his wretched mills. What shall you do about the
      attack in The Summons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignore it. It would be difficult to answer. Besides, people easily
      forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dangerous creed, Ban. And a cynical one. I don&rsquo;t want you
      to be cynical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never shall be again, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless?&rdquo; she prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rests with you, Io,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once she took flight. &ldquo;Am I to be keeper of your spirit?&rdquo;
      she protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to be your professional
      adviser. Why don&rsquo;t you invite a crowd of us down to get the election
      returns?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make up your party,&rdquo; assented Banneker. &ldquo;Keep it small;
      say a dozen, and we can use my office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fateful evening there duly appeared Io with a group of a dozen
      friends. From the first, it was a time of triumph. Laird took the lead and
      kept it. By midnight, the result was a certainty. In a balcony speech from
      his headquarters the victor had given generous recognition for his success
      to The Patriot, mentioning Banneker by name. When the report reached them
      Esther Forbes solemnly crowned the host with a wreath composed of the
      &ldquo;flimsy&rdquo; on which the rescript of the speech had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skoal to Ban!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Maker of kings and mayors
      and things. Skoal! As you&rsquo;re a viking or something of the sort, the
      Norse salutation is appropriate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be Danish to be accurate,&rdquo; he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a hardy, seafaring race,&rdquo; she chattered.
      &ldquo;And that reminds me. Come on out to the South Seas with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;When do we start? To-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not joking. You&rsquo;ve certainly earned a vacation.
      And of course you needn&rsquo;t enlist for the whole six months if that is
      too long. Dad has let me have the yacht. There&rsquo;ll only be a dozen.
      Io&rsquo;s going along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker shot one startled, incredulous look at Io Eyre, and instantly
      commanded himself, to the point of controlling his voice to gayety as he
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who would tell the new mayor how he should run the city, if I
      deserted him? No, Esther, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m chained to this desk.
      Ask me sometime when you&rsquo;re cruising as far as Coney Island.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io sat silent, and with a set smile, listening to Herbert Cressey&rsquo;s
      account of an election row in the district where he was volunteer watcher.
      When the party broke up, she went home with Densmore without giving
      Banneker the chance of a word with her. It seemed to him that there was a
      mute plea for pardon in her face as she bade him good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon next day she called him on the &lsquo;phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just to tell you that I&rsquo;m coming as usual Saturday evening,&rdquo;
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you leave on your cruise?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until next week. I&rsquo;ll tell you when I see you. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Banneker seen Io in such difficult mood as she exhibited on the
      Saturday. She had come early to The House With Three Eyes, accompanied by
      Densmore who looked in just for one drink before going to a much-touted
      boxing-match in Jersey. Through the evening she deliberately avoided
      seeing Banneker alone for so much as the space of a query put and
      answered, dividing her attention between an enraptured master of the
      violin who had come after his concert, and an aged and bewildered inventor
      who, in a long career of secluded toil, had never beheld anything like
      this brilliant creature with her intelligent and quickening interest in
      what he had to tell her. Rivalry between the two geniuses inspired the
      musician to make an offer which he would hardly have granted to royalty
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a time, when zese chatterers are gon-away, I shall play for
      you. Is zere some one here who can accompany properly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Necessarily Io sent for Banneker to find out. Yes; young Mackey was coming
      a little later; he was a brilliant amateur and would be flattered at the
      opportunity. With a direct insistence difficult to deny, Banneker drew Io
      aside for a moment. Her eyes glinted dangerously as she faced him, alone
      for the moment, with the question that was the salute before the crossing
      of blades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really going, Io?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that, for one reason&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled faintly, but
      resolutely&mdash;&ldquo;The Patriot needs your guiding inspiration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All The Patriot&rsquo;s troubles are over. It&rsquo;s plain sailing
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of The Patriot&rsquo;s editor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite able to take care of himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Into his voice there suffused the first ring of anger that she had ever
      heard from him; cold and formidable. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Io. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child&rsquo;s answer. Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to be flattered?&rdquo; She raised to his, eyes that
      danced with an impish and perverse light. &ldquo;Call it escape, if you
      wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or from myself. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to think that I&rsquo;m
      afraid of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to think that you&rsquo;re afraid of
      anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; But her tone was that of the defiance which
      seeks to encourage itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it a desertion,&rdquo; he said steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! You&rsquo;re secure. You need nothing but what you&rsquo;ve
      got. Power, reputation, position, success. What more can heart desire?&rdquo;
      she taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She quivered under the blunt word, but rallied to say lightly: &ldquo;Six
      months isn&rsquo;t long. Though I may stretch it to a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too long for endurance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll do very well without me, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I? When am I to see you again before you go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her raised eyebrows were like an affront. &ldquo;Are we to see each other
      again? Of course, it would be polite of you to come to the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a controlled and dangerous gravity in his next question. &ldquo;Io,
      have we quarreled?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd! Of course not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew how I dislike fruitless explanations!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at once. Io&rsquo;s strong and beautiful hands, which had been
      lying in her lap, suddenly interlocked, clenching close together. But her
      face disclosed nothing. The virtuoso, who had been hopefully hovering in
      the offing, bore down to take the vacated chair. He would have found the
      lovely young Mrs. Eyre distrait and irresponsive had he not been too happy
      babbling of his own triumphs to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon zey haf growed thin, zis crowd,&rdquo; said the violinist, who
      took pride in his mastery of idiom. &ldquo;Zen, when zere remains but a
      small few, I play for you. You sit <i>zere</i>, in ze leetle garden of
      flowers.&rdquo; He indicated the secluded seat near the stairway, where
      she had sat with Ban on the occasion of her first visit to The House With
      Three Eyes. &ldquo;Not too far; not too near. From zere you shall not see;
      but you shall think you hear ze stars make for you harmonies of ze high
      places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mackey, having arrived, commended himself to the condescending
      master by a meekly worshipful attitude. Barely a score of people remained
      in the great room. The word went about that they were in for one of those
      occasional treats which made The House With Three Eyes unique. The
      fortunate lingerers disposed themselves about the room. Io slipped into
      the nook designated for her. Banneker was somewhere in the background; her
      veiled glance could not discover where. The music began.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played Tschaikowsky first, the tender and passionate &ldquo;Melodie&rdquo;;
      then a lilting measure from Debussy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faun,&rdquo; followed
      by a solemnly lovely Brahms arrangement devised by the virtuoso himself.
      At the dying-out of the applause, the violinist addressed himself to the
      nook where Io was no more than a vague, faërie figure to his eyes, misty
      through interlaced bloom and leafage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Madame, I play you somezing of a American. Ver&rsquo;
      beautiful, it is. Not for violin. For voice, contralto. I sing it to you&mdash;on
      ze G-string, which weep when it sing; weep for lost dreams. It is called
      &lsquo;Illusion,&rsquo; ze song.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his bow, and at the first bar Io&rsquo;s heart gave a quick,
      thick sob within her breast. It was the music which Camilla Van Arsdale
      had played that night when winds and forest leaves murmured the overtones;
      when earth and heaven were hushed to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban!&rdquo; cried Io&rsquo;s spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noiseless and swift, Banneker, answering the call, bent over her. She
      whispered, softly, passionately, her lips hardly stirring the
      melody-thrilled air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I hurt you so! I&rsquo;m going because I must; because I
      daren&rsquo;t stay. You can understand, Ban!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The music died. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Banneker. Then, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      go, Io!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see you before. When we&rsquo;re
      ourselves. We can&rsquo;t talk now. Not with this terrible music in our
      blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and went forward to thank the player with such a light in her
      eyes and such a fervor in her words that he mentally added another to his
      list of conquests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party broke up. After that magic music, people wanted to be out of the
      light and the stir; to carry its pure passion forth into the dark places,
      to cherish and dream it over again.... Banneker sat before the broad
      fireplace in the laxity of a still grief. Io was going away from him. For
      a six-month. For a year. For an eternity. Going away from him, bearing his
      whole heart with her, as she had left him after the night on the river,
      left him to the searing memory of that mad, sweet cleavage of her lips to
      his, the passionate offer of her awakened womanhood in uttermost surrender
      of life at the roaring gates of death....
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps, light, firm, unhesitant, approached across the broad floor from
      the hallway. Banneker sat rigid, incredulous, afraid to stir, as the
      sleeper fears to break the spell of a tenuous and lovely dream, until Io&rsquo;s
      voice spoke his name. He would have jumped to his feet, but the strong
      pressure of her hands on his shoulders restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Stay as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had gone,&rdquo; he said thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great log toppled in the fireplace, showering its sparks in prodigal
      display.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember our fire, on the river-bank?&rdquo; said the voice
      of the girl, Io, across the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just you and I. Man and woman. Alone in the world. Sometimes I
      think it has always been so with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no world of our own, Io,&rdquo; he said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heresy, Ban; heresy! Of course we have. An inner world. If we could
      forget&mdash;everything outside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not good at forgetting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her fingers, languid and tremulous, at his throat, her heart&rsquo;s
      strong throb against his shoulder as she bent, the sweet breath of her
      whisper stirring the hair at his temple:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth closed down upon his, flower-sweet, petal-light, and was
      withdrawn. She leaned back, gazing at him from half-closed, inscrutable
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for good-bye, Io?&rdquo; With all his self-control, he
      could not keep his voice steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been too many good-byes between us,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his head, attentive to a stir at the door, which immediately
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was Archie, come after you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archie isn&rsquo;t coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll send for the car and take you home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you understand, Ban? I&rsquo;m not going home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Io Eyre was one of those women before whom Scandal seems to lose its teeth
      if not its tongue. She had always assumed the superb attitude toward the
      world in which she moved. &ldquo;They say?&mdash;What do they say?&mdash;Let
      them say!&rdquo; might have been her device, too genuinely expressive of
      her to be consciously contemptuous. Where another might have suffered in
      reputation by constant companionship with a man as brilliant, as
      conspicuous, as phenomenal of career as Errol Banneker, Io passed on her
      chosen way, serene and scatheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tongues wagged, indeed; whispers spread; that was inevitable. But to this
      Io was impervious. When Banneker, troubled lest any breath should sully
      her reputation who was herself unsullied, in his mind, would have
      advocated caution, she refused to consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I skulk?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they met and lunched or dined at the most conspicuous restaurants,
      defying Scandal, whereupon Scandal began to wonder whether, all things
      considered, there were anything more to it than one of those flirtations
      which, after a time of faithful adherence, become standardized into
      respectability and a sort of tolerant recognition. What, after all, is
      respectability but the brand of the formalist upon standardization?
    </p>
    <p>
      With the distaste and effort which Ban always felt in mentioning her
      husband&rsquo;s name to Io, he asked her one day about any possible danger
      from Eyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with assurance. &ldquo;I owe Del nothing. That
      is understood between us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the tittle-tattle that must be going the rounds should come
      to his ears&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the truth should come to his ears,&rdquo; she replied
      tranquilly, &ldquo;it would make no difference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ban looked at her, hesitant to be convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; she asseverated, nodding, &ldquo;After
      his outbreak in Paris&mdash;it was on our wedding trip&mdash;I gave him a
      choice. I would either divorce him, or I would hold myself absolutely free
      of him so far as any claim, actual or moral, went. The one thing I
      undertook was that I would never involve his name in any open scandal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been so particular,&rdquo; said Ban gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of late he has. Since I had Cousin Billy Enderby go to him about
      the dancer. I won&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s run absolutely straight since.
      Poor Del! He can&rsquo;t, I suppose. But, at least, he&rsquo;s respected
      the bargain to the extent of being prudent. I shall respect mine to the
      same extent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io,&rdquo; he burst out passionately, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one
      thing in the world I really want; for you to be free of him absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, Ban&rsquo; Can&rsquo;t you be content&mdash;with
      me? I&rsquo;ve told you I am free of him. I&rsquo;m not really his wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;re mine,&rdquo; he declared with jealous intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo; Her voice trembled, thrilled. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know yet how wholly I&rsquo;m yours. Oh, it isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i>
      alone, Ban. But in spirit and thought. In the world of shadowed and lovely
      things that we made for ourselves long ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to have to endure this atmosphere of secrecy, of stealth, of
      danger to you,&rdquo; he fretted. &ldquo;You could get your divorce.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do understand,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Del?&rdquo; She drew a quick breath. &ldquo;How could you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wholly through an accident. A medical man, a slimy little reptile,
      surprised his secret and inadvertently passed it on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward to him from her corner of the settee, all courage and
      truth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that you know, though I couldn&rsquo;t tell
      you, myself. You&rsquo;ll see now that I couldn&rsquo;t leave him to face
      it alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You couldn&rsquo;t. If you did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, and I love you for that, too,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice
      and eyes one caress to him. &ldquo;I wonder how I ever made myself believe
      that I could get over loving you! Now, I&rsquo;ve got to pay for my
      mistake. Ban, do you remember the &lsquo;Babbling Babson&rsquo;? The
      imbecile who saw me from the train that day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember every smallest thing in any way connected with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to hear you say that. It makes up for the bad times, in
      between. The Babbler has turned up. He&rsquo;s been living abroad for a
      few years. I saw him at a tea last week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He tried to be coy and facetious. I snubbed him soundly.
      Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t wise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well he used to have the reputation of writing on the sly for The
      Searchlight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sewer-sheet! You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d dare do anything
      of the sort about us? Why, what would he have to go on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does The Searchlight have to go on in most of its lies, and
      hints, and innuendoes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Io, even if it did publish&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ban, if it did&mdash;it
      would make it impossible for us to go on as we have been. Don&rsquo;t you
      see that it would?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned sallow under his ruddy skin. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stop it, one
      way or another. I&rsquo;ll put the fear of God into that filthy old worm
      that runs the blackmail shop. The first thing is to find out, though,
      whether there&rsquo;s anything in it. I did hear a hint....&rdquo; He lost
      himself in musings, trying to recall an occult remark which the obsequious
      Ely Ives had made to him sometime before. &ldquo;And I know where I can do
      it,&rdquo; he ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go to Ives for anything was heartily distasteful to him. But this was a
      necessity. He cautiously questioned the unofficial factotum of his
      employer. Had Ives heard anything of a projected attack on him in The
      Searchlight? Why, yes; Ives had (naturally, since it was he and not Babson
      who had furnished the material). In fact, he had an underground wire into
      the office of that weekly of spice and scurrility which might be tapped to
      oblige a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker winced at the characterization, but confessed that he would be
      appreciative of any information. In three days a galley proof of the
      paragraph was in his hands. It confirmed his angriest fears. Publication
      of it would smear Io&rsquo;s name with scandal, and, by consequence,
      direct the leering gaze of the world upon their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this; blackmail?&rdquo; he asked Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wrote it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reads like the old buzzard&rsquo;s own style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see him,&rdquo; said Banneker, half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll see him.&rdquo;
      Ives set forth in detail the venerable editor&rsquo;s procedure as to
      troublesome callers. It was specific and curious. Foreseeing that he would
      probably have to fight with his opponent&rsquo;s weapons, Banneker sought
      out Russell Edmonds and asked for all the information regarding The
      Searchlight and its proprietor-editor in the veteran&rsquo;s possession.
      Edmonds had a fund of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t smoke him out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That skunk
      lives in a deep hole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t smoke him out, I&rsquo;ll blast him out,&rdquo;
      declared Banneker, and set himself to the composition of an editorial
      which consumed the remainder of the working day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a typed copy in his pocket, he called, a little before noon, at the
      office of The Searchlight and sent in his card to Major Bussey. The Major
      was not in. When was he expected? As for that, there was no telling; he
      was quite irregular. Very well, Mr. Banneker would wait. Oh, that was
      quite useless; was it about something in the magazine; wouldn&rsquo;t one
      of the other editors do? Without awaiting an answer, the anemic and
      shrewd-faced office girl who put the questions disappeared, and presently
      returned, followed by a tailor-made woman of thirty-odd, with a delicate,
      secret-keeping mouth and heavy-lidded, deep-hued eyes, altogether a
      seductive figure. She smiled confidently up at Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted so much to meet you,&rdquo; she disclosed,
      giving him a quick, gentle hand pressure. &ldquo;So has Major Bussey. Too
      bad he&rsquo;s out of town. Did you want to see him personally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite personally.&rdquo; Banneker returned her smile with one even
      more friendly and confiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I do? Come into my office, won&rsquo;t you? I
      represent him in some things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this one, I hope,&rdquo; he replied, following her to an
      inner room. &ldquo;It is about a paragraph not yet published, which might
      be misconstrued.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think any one could possibly misconstrue it,&rdquo;
      she retorted, with a flash of wicked mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the paragraph to which I refer, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker regarded her with grave and appreciative urbanity. All was going
      precisely as Ely Ives had prognosticated; the denial of the presence of
      the editor; the appearance of this alluring brunette as whipping-girl to
      assume the burden of his offenses with the calm impunity of her sex and
      charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is very clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she returned
      innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As authentic, let us say, as your authorship of the paragraph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I wrote it? What object should I have in
      trying to deceive you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed! By the way, what is Major Bussey&rsquo;s price?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Banneker!&rdquo; Was it sheer delight in deviltry, or
      amusement at his direct and unstrategic method that sparkled in her face.
      &ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t credit the silly stories of&mdash;well,
      blackmail, about us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be money,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;But, on the whole, I
      think it&rsquo;s something else. Something he wants from The Patriot,
      perhaps. Immunity? Would that be it? Not that I mean, necessarily, to
      deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your proposition?&rdquo; she asked confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I advance one when I don&rsquo;t know what your principal
      wants?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paragraph was written in good faith,&rdquo; she asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And could be withdrawn in equal good faith?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her laugh was silvery clear. &ldquo;Very possibly. Under proper
      representations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d better deal direct with the
      Major?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She studied his face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she began, and instantly refuted
      herself. &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t trust you. There&rsquo;s trouble under
      that smooth smile of yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>you&rsquo;re</i> not afraid of me, surely,&rdquo; said
      Banneker. He had found out one important point; her manner when she said
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; indicated that the proprietor was in the building. Now
      he continued: &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think I am.&rdquo; There was a little catch
      in her breath. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d be dangerous to any woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker, his eyes fixed on hers, played for time and a further lead with
      a banality. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pleased to flatter me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased to be flattered?&rdquo; she returned
      provocatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand on her wrist. She swayed to him with a slow, facile
      yielding. He caught her other wrist, and the grip of his two hands seemed
      to bite into the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re <i>that</i> kind, too, are you!&rdquo; he sneered,
      holding her eyes as cruelly as he had clutched her wrists. &ldquo;Keep
      quiet! Now, you&rsquo;re to do as I tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Ely Ives, in describing the watchwoman at the portals of scandal, had
      told him that she was susceptible to a properly timed bluff. &ldquo;A
      woman she had slandered once stabbed her; since then you can get her nerve
      by a quick attack. Treat her rough.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him, fearfully, half-hypnotized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the door leading to Bussey&rsquo;s office? Don&rsquo;t
      speak! Nod.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumb and stricken, she obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there. Don&rsquo;t you dare make a movement or a
      noise. If you do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shifting his grasp, he caught her up and with easy power tossed her upon a
      broad divan. From its springy surface she shot up, as it seemed to him,
      halfway to the ceiling, rigid and staring, a ludicrous simulacrum of a
      glassy-eyed doll. He heard the protesting &ldquo;ping!&rdquo; and &ldquo;berr-rr-rr&rdquo;
      of a broken spring as she fell back. The traverse of a narrow hallway and
      a turn through a half-open door took him into the presence of bearded
      benevolence making notes at a desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get here? And who the devil are you?&rdquo; demanded
      the guiding genius of The Searchlight, looking up irritably. He raised his
      voice. &ldquo;Con!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a side room appeared a thick, heavy-shouldered man with a feral
      countenance, who slouched aggressively forward, as the intruder announced
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheest!&rdquo; hissed the thick bouncer in tones of dismay, and
      stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, Banneker recognized him as one of the policemen whom his evidence
      had retired from the force in the wharf-gang investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Banneker,&rdquo; muttered the editor. His right hand moved
      slowly, stealthily, toward a lower drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it, Major!&rdquo; implored Con in acute anguish. &ldquo;Canche&rsquo;
      see he&rsquo;s gotche&rsquo; covered through his pocket!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stealthy hand returned to the sight of all men and fussed among some
      papers on the desk-top. Major Bussey said peevishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill that paragraph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What par&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fence with me,&rdquo; struck in Banneker sharply.
      &ldquo;You know what one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Bussey swept his gaze around the room for help or inspiration. The
      sight of the burly ex-policeman, stricken and shifting his weight from one
      foot to the other, disconcerted him sadly; but he plucked up courage to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts are well authent&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Banneker cut him short. &ldquo;Facts! There isn&rsquo;t the
      semblance of a fact in the whole thing. Hints, slurs, innuendoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Libel does not exist when&mdash;&rdquo; feebly began the editor,
      and stopped because Banneker was laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you read that,&rdquo; said the visitor, contemptuously
      tossing the typed script of his new-wrought editorial on the desk. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i>
      libellous, if you choose. But I don&rsquo;t think you would sue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Bussey read the caption, a typical Banneker eye-catcher, &ldquo;The
      Rattlesnake Dies Out; But the Pen-Viper is Still With Us.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t care to indulge myself with your literary efforts at present,
      Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; he said languidly. &ldquo;Is this the answer to our
      paragraph?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the beginning. I propose to drive you out of town and suppress
      The Searchlight.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fair challenge. I&rsquo;ll accept it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was prepared to have you take that attitude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Banneker; you could hardly expect to come here and
      blackmail me by threats&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for my alternative,&rdquo; proceeded the visitor calmly.
      &ldquo;You are proposing to publish a slur on the reputation of an
      innocent woman who&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Innocent!&rdquo; murmured the Major with malign relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Major!&rdquo; implored Con, the body-guard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      a killer, he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m particularly afraid of you, after
      all,&rdquo; declared the exponent of The Searchlight, and Banneker felt a
      twinge of dismay lest he might have derived, somewhence, an access of
      courage. &ldquo;A Wild West shooting is one thing, and cold-blooded,
      premeditated murder is another. You&rsquo;d go to the chair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheerfully,&rdquo; assented Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bussey, lifting the typed sheets before him, began to read. Presently his
      face flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you print this sort of thing, you&rsquo;d have my office
      mobbed,&rdquo; he cried indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous! And this&mdash;if this isn&rsquo;t an
      incitement to lynching&mdash;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare publish this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Bussey&rsquo;s wizened and philanthropic face took on the cast of
      careful thought. At length he spoke with the manner of an elder bestowing
      wisdom upon youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A controversy such as this would do nobody any good. I have always
      been opposed to journalistic backbitings. Therefore we will let this
      matter lie. I will kill the paragraph. Not that I&rsquo;m afraid of your
      threats; nor of your pen, for that matter. But in the best interests of
      our common profession&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said Banneker, and walked out, leaving the Major
      stranded upon the ebb tide of his platitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker retailed the episode to Edmonds, for his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid of your gun, a little,&rdquo; pronounced the
      expert; &ldquo;and more of your pen. I think he&rsquo;ll keep faith in
      this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as I hold over him the threat of The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No longer. It&rsquo;s a vengeful kind of vermin, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop, am I a common, ordinary blackmailer? Or am I not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shook his head, grayed by a quarter-century of struggles and
      problems. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange game, the newspaper game,&rdquo; he
      opined.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      All had worked out, in the matter of The Searchlight, quite as much to Mr.
      Ely Ives&rsquo;s satisfaction as to that of Banneker. From his boasted and
      actual underground wire into that culture-bed of spiced sewage (at the
      farther end of which was the facile brunette whom the visiting editor had
      so harshly treated), he had learned the main details of the interview and
      reported them to Mr. Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Banneker now be good?&rdquo; rhetorically queried Ives,
      pursing up his small face into an expression of judicious appreciation.
      &ldquo;He <i>will</i> be good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal gave the subject his habitual calm and impersonal consideration.
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been lately,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Several of
      his editorials have had quite the air of challenge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before he turned blackmailer. Blackmail,&rdquo;
      philosophized the astute Ives, &ldquo;is a gun that you&rsquo;ve got to
      keep pointed all the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. So long as he has Bussey covered by the muzzle of The
      Patriot, The Searchlight behaves itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does. But if ever he laid down his gun, Bussey would make hash
      of him and his lady-love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; interrogated Marrineal. &ldquo;Do you really
      think&mdash;&rdquo; His uplifted brows, sparse on his broad and candid
      forehead, consummated the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply the factotum gave him a succinct if distorted version of the
      romance in the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dished him for Eyre,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;and now she&rsquo;s
      dishing Eyre for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bussey&rsquo;s got all this?&rdquo; inquired Marrineal, and upon
      the other&rsquo;s careless &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; added, &ldquo;It
      must grind his soul not to be able to use it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or not to get paid for suppressing it,&rdquo; grinned Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But does Banneker understand that it&rsquo;s fear of his pen, and
      not of being killed, that binds Bussey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken care to rub that in. Told him of
      other cases where the old Major was threatened with all sorts of
      manhandling; scared out of his wits at first, but always got over it and
      came back in The Searchlight, taking his chance of being killed. The old
      vulture really isn&rsquo;t a coward, though he&rsquo;s a wary bird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Banneker really kill him, do you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t insure his life for five cents,&rdquo; returned
      the other with conviction. &ldquo;Your editor is crazy-mad over this Mrs.
      Eyre. So there you have him delivered, shorn and helpless, and Delilah
      doesn&rsquo;t even suspect that she&rsquo;s acting as our agent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal&rsquo;s eyes fixed themselves in a lifeless sort of stare upon a
      far corner of the ceiling. Recognizing this as a sign of inward
      cogitation, the vizier of his more private interests sat waiting. Without
      changing the direction of his gaze, the proprietor indicated a check in
      his ratiocination by saying incompletely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if she divorced Eyre and married Banneker&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives completed it for him. &ldquo;That would spike The Searchlight&rsquo;s
      guns, you think? Perhaps. But if she were going to divorce Eyre, she&rsquo;d
      have done it long ago, wouldn&rsquo;t she? I think she&rsquo;ll wait. He
      won&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then our hold on Banneker, through his ability to intimidate The
      Searchlight, depends on the life of a paretic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paretic is too strong a word&mdash;yet. But it comes to about that.
      Except&mdash;he&rsquo;ll want a lot of money to marry Io Eyre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants a lot, anyway,&rdquo; smiled Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want more. She&rsquo;s an expensive luxury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can get more. Any time when he chooses to handle The Patriot so
      that it attracts instead of offends the big advertisers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put the screws on him now, Mr. Marrineal?&rdquo;
      smirked Ives with thin-lipped malignancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal frowned. His cold blood inclined him to be deliberate; the
      ophidian habit, slow-moving until ready to strike. He saw no reason for
      risking a venture which became safer the further it progressed.
      Furthermore, he disliked direct, unsolicited advice. Ignoring Ives&rsquo;s
      remark he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are his investments going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives grinned again. &ldquo;Down. Who put him into United Thread? Do you
      know, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace Vanney. He has been tipping it off quietly to the club lot.
      Wants to get out from under, himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing about it, though, that puzzles me. If he
      took old Vanney&rsquo;s tip to buy for a rise, why did he go after the
      Sippiac Mills with those savage editorials? They&rsquo;re mainly
      responsible for the legislative investigation that knocked eight points
      off of United Thread.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably to prove his editorial independence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom? You?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To himself,&rdquo; said Marrineal with an acumen quite above the
      shrewdness of an Ives to grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter nodded intelligently, and remarked: &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s
      money-crazy you&rsquo;ve got him, anyway, sooner or later. And now that he&rsquo;s
      woman-crazy, too&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never understand just how sane Mr. Banneker is,&rdquo;
      broke in Marrineal coldly. He was a very sane man, himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a lot of the sane ones get stung on the Street,&rdquo;
      moralized Ives. &ldquo;I guess the only way to beat that game is to get
      crazy and take all the chances. Mr. Banneker stands to drop half a year&rsquo;s
      salary in U.T. alone unless there&rsquo;s a turn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal delivered another well-thought-out bit of wisdom. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
      any judge, he wants a paper of his own. Well ... give me three years more
      of him and he can have it. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll make much
      headway against The Patriot, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years? Bussey and The Searchlight ought to hold him that
      long. Unless, of course, he gets over his infatuation in the meantime.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; surmised Marrineal, eyeing him with distaste,
      &ldquo;I suppose you think that he would equally lose interest in
      protecting her from The Searchlight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s a woman to expect!&rdquo; said Ives blandly, and
      took his dismissal for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only recently that Ives had taken to coming to The Patriot office.
      No small interest and conjecture were aroused among the editorial staff as
      to his exact status, stimulus to gossip being afforded by the rumor that
      he had been, from Marrineal&rsquo;s privy purse, shifted to the office
      payroll. Russell Edmonds solved and imparted the secret to Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ives? Oh, he&rsquo;s the office sandbag.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Translate, Pop. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an invention of Marrineal&rsquo;s. Very ingenious. It
      was devised as a weapon against libel suits. Suppose some local
      correspondent from Hohokus or Painted Post sends in a story on the
      Honorable Aminadab Quince that looks to be O.K., but is actually full of
      bad breaks. The Honorable Aminadab smells money in it and likes the smell.
      Starts a libel suit. On the facts, he&rsquo;s got us: the fellow that got
      pickled and broke up the Methodist revival wasn&rsquo;t Aminadab at all,
      but his tough brother. If it gets into court we&rsquo;re stung. Well, up
      goes little Weaselfoot Ives to Hohokus. Sniffs around and spooks around
      and is a good fellow at the hotel, and possibly spends a little money
      where it&rsquo;s most needed, and one day turns up at the Quince mansion.
      &lsquo;Senator, I represent The Patriot.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t want to
      see you at all. Talk to my lawyer.&rsquo; &lsquo;But he might not
      understand my errand. It relates to an indictment handed down in 1884 for
      malversasion of school funds.&rsquo; &lsquo;Young man, do you dare to
      intimate&mdash;&rsquo; and so forth and so on; bluster and bluff and
      threat. Says Ives, very cool: &lsquo;Let me have your denial in writing
      and we&rsquo;ll print it opposite the certified copy of the indictment.&rsquo;
      The old boy begins to whimper; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s outlawed. It was all
      wrong, anyway.&rsquo; Ives is sympathetic, but stands pat. Drop the suit
      and The Patriot will be considerate and settle the legal fees. Aminadab
      drops, ten times out of ten. The sandbag has put him away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be an eleventh case where there&rsquo;s nothing on
      the man that&rsquo;s suing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say a ninety-ninth. One libel suit in a hundred may be brought in
      good faith. But we never settle until after Ives has done his little
      prowl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds bad, Pop. But is it so bad, after all? We&rsquo;ve got to
      protect ourselves against a hold-up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty work, but somebody&rsquo;s got to do it: ay&mdash;yes? I
      agree with you. As a means of self-defense it is excusable. But the
      operations of the sandbag have gone far beyond libel in Ives&rsquo;s
      hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they? To what extent?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any. His little private detective agency&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a
      couple of our porch-climbing, keyhole reporters secretly assigned to him
      at call for special work&rsquo;&mdash;looks after any man we&rsquo;ve got
      or are likely to have trouble with; advertisers who don&rsquo;t come
      across properly, city officials who play in with the other papers too
      much, politicians&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s rank blackmail!&rdquo; exclaimed Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried far enough it is. So far it&rsquo;s only private
      information for the private archives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrineal&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He and his private counsel, old Mark Stecklin, are the keepers
      of them. Now, suppose Judge Enderby runs afoul of our interests, as he is
      bound to do sooner or later. Little Weaselfoot gets on his trail&mdash;probably
      is on it already&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll spend a year if necessary watching,
      waiting, sniffing out something that he can use as a threat or a bludgeon
      or a bargain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What quarrel have we got with Enderby?&rdquo; inquired Banneker
      with lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, now. But we&rsquo;ll be after him hot and heavy within a
      year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the editorial page,&rdquo; declared Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope not. It would be rather a right-about, wouldn&rsquo;t
      it? But Marrineal isn&rsquo;t afraid of a right-about. You know his creed
      as to his readers: &lsquo;The public never remembers.&rsquo; Of course,
      you realize what Marrineal is after, politically.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s never said a word to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to me. But others have. The mayoralty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He&rsquo;s quietly building up his machine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Laird will run for reelection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll knife Laird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true Laird hasn&rsquo;t treated us very well, in the
      matter of backing our policies,&rdquo; admitted Banneker thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;The Combined Street Railway franchise, for instance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was right in that and you were wrong, Ban. He had to follow the
      comptroller there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that where our split with Enderby is going to come? Over the
      election?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Enderby is the brains and character back of the Laird
      administration. He represents the clean government crowd, with its
      financial power.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker stirred fretfully in his chair. &ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; he
      growled. &ldquo;I wish we could run this paper <i>as</i> a newspaper and
      not as a chestnut rake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet and simple life would be!&rdquo; mocked the veteran.
      &ldquo;Still, you know, if you&rsquo;re going to use The Patriot as a
      blunderbuss to point at the heads of your own enemies, you can&rsquo;t
      blame the owner if he&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Marrineal knows?&rdquo; interposed Banneker sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About The Searchlight matter? You can bet on one thing, Ban.
      Everything that Ely Ives knows, Tertius Marrineal knows. So far as Ives
      thinks it advisable for him to know, that is. Over and above which Tertius
      is no fool, himself. You may have noticed that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bothered me from time to time,&rdquo; admitted the other
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll bother both of us more, presently,&rdquo; prophesied
      Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve been playing direct into Marrineal&rsquo;s hands in
      attacking Laird on the franchise matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Keep on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange advice from you, Pop. You think my position on that is
      wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? You think it&rsquo;s right. Therefore, go ahead. Why
      quit a line of policy just because it obliges your employes? Don&rsquo;t
      be over-conscientious, son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suspected for some time that the political news was
      being adroitly manipulated against the administration. Has Marrineal tried
      to ring you in on that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows that, in the main, I&rsquo;m a Laird man. Laird is giving
      us what we asked for, an honest administration.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose, when Marrineal develops his plans, he comes to you, which
      would be his natural course, to handle the news end of the anti-Laird
      campaign. What would you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so easy for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so easy as you think, son. Even though there&rsquo;s a lot of
      stuff being put over in the news columns that makes me sore and sick.
      Marrineal&rsquo;s little theory of using news as a lever is being put into
      practice pretty widely. Also we&rsquo;re selling it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selling our news columns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em. For advertising. You&rsquo;re well out of any
      responsibility for that department. I&rsquo;d resign to-morrow if it weren&rsquo;t
      for the fact that Marrineal still wants to cocker up the labor crowd for
      his political purposes, and so gives me a free hand in my own special
      line. By the way, he&rsquo;s got the Veridian matter all nicely smoothed
      out. Oh, my, yes! Fired the general manager, put in all sorts of reforms,
      recognized the union, the whole programme! That&rsquo;s to spike
      McClintick&rsquo;s guns if he tries to trot out Veridian again as proof
      that Marrineal is, at heart, anti-labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s anti-anything that&rsquo;s anti-Marrineal, and
      pro-anything that&rsquo;s pro-Marrineal. Haven&rsquo;t you measured him
      yet? All policy, no principle; there&rsquo;s Mr. Tertius Marrineal for
      you.... Ban, it&rsquo;s really you that holds me to this shop.&rdquo;
      Through convolutions of smoke from his tiny pipe, the old stager regarded
      the young star of journalism with a quaint and placid affection. &ldquo;Whatever
      rotten stuff is going on in the business and news department, your page
      goes straight and speaks clear.... I wonder how long Marrineal will stand
      for it ... I wonder what he intends for the next campaign.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my proprietor runs for office, I can&rsquo;t very well not
      support him,&rdquo; said Banneker, troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well. The pinch will come as to what you&rsquo;re going to
      do about Laird. According to my private information, he&rsquo;s coming
      back at The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my editorials on the Combined franchise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. He&rsquo;s too straight to resent honest criticism. No; for
      some of the crooked stuff that we&rsquo;re running in our political news.
      Besides, some suspicious and informed soul in the administration has read
      between our political lines, and got a peep of the aspiring Tertius
      girding himself for contest. Result, the city advertising is to be taken
      from The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed no more than a mechanical reckoning of percentages to tell
      Banneker that this implied a serious diminution of his own income.
      Further, such a procedure would be in effect a repudiation of The Patriot
      and its editorial support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rotten deal!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Just politics. Justifiable, too, I should say, as politics go.
      I doubt whether Laird would do it of his own motion; he plays a higher
      game than that. But it isn&rsquo;t strictly within his province either to
      effect or prevent. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s going to be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he wants to fight us&mdash;&rdquo; began Banneker with gloom in
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to fight anybody,&rdquo; cut in the expert.
      &ldquo;He wants to be mayor and run the city for what seems to him the
      city&rsquo;s best good. If he thought Marrineal would carry on his work as
      mayor, I doubt if he&rsquo;d oppose him. But our shrewd old friend,
      Enderby, isn&rsquo;t of that mind. Enderby understands Marrineal. He&rsquo;ll
      fight to the finish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds left his friend in a glum perturbation of mind. Enderby understood
      Marrineal, did he? Banneker wished that he himself did. If he could have
      come to grips with his employer, he would at least have known now where to
      take his stand. But Marrineal was elusive. No, not even elusive;
      quiescent. He waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time passed, Banneker&rsquo;s editorial and personal involvements grew
      more complex. At what moment might a pressure from above close down on his
      pen, and with what demand? How should he act in the crisis thus forced, at
      Marrineal&rsquo;s slow pleasure? Take Edmonds&rsquo;s Gordian recourse;
      resign? But he was on the verge of debt. His investments had gone badly;
      he prided himself on the thought that it was partly through his own
      immovable uprightness. Now, this threat to his badly needed percentages!
      Surely The Patriot ought to be making a greater profit than it showed, on
      its steadily waxing circulation. Why had he ever let himself be wrenched
      from his first and impregnable system of a straight payment on increase of
      circulation? Would it be possible to force Marrineal back into that
      agreement? No income was too great, surely, to recompense for such trouble
      of soul as The Patriot inflicted upon its editorial mouthpiece.... Through
      the murk of thoughts shot, golden-rayed, the vision of Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      No world could be other than glorious in which she lived and loved him and
      was his.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sheltered beneath the powerful pen of Banneker, his idyll, fulfilled,
      lengthened out over radiant months. Io was to him all that dreams had ever
      promised or portrayed. Their association, flowering to the full amidst the
      rush and turmoil of the city, was the antithesis to its budding in the
      desert peace. To see the more of his mistress, Banneker became an active
      participant in that class of social functions which get themselves
      chronicled in the papers. Wise in her day and her protective instinct of
      love, Io pointed out that the more he was identified with her set, the
      less occasion would there be for comment upon their being seen together.
      And they were seen together much.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lunched with him at his downtown club, dined with him at Sherry&rsquo;s,
      met him at The Retreat and was driven back home in his car, sometimes with
      Archie Densmore for a third, not infrequently alone. Considerate hostesses
      seated them next each other at dinners: it was deemed an evidence of being
      &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; thus to accommodate them. The openness of their
      intimacy went far to rob calumny of its sting. And Banneker&rsquo;s
      ingrained circumspection of the man trained in the open, applied to <i>les
      convenances</i>, was a protection in itself. Moreover, there was in his
      devotion, conspicuous though it was, an air of chivalry, a breath of
      fragrance from a world of higher romance, which rendered women in
      particular charitable of judgment toward the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes in the late afternoon Banneker&rsquo;s private numbered
      telephone rang, and an impersonal voice delivered a formal message. And
      that evening Banneker (called out of town, no matter how pressing an
      engagement he might have had) sat in The House With Three Eyes, now
      darkened of vision, thrilling and longing for her step in the dim side
      passage. There was risk of disaster. But Io willed to take it; was proud
      to take it for her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immersed in a happiness and a hope which vivified every motion of his
      life, Banneker was nevertheless under a continuous strain of watchfulness;
      the <i>qui vive</i> of the knight who guards his lady with leveled lance
      from a never-ceasing threat. At the point of his weapon cowered and
      crouched the dragon of The Searchlight, with envenomed fangs of scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the months rounded out to a year, he grew, not less careful, indeed,
      but more confident. Eyre had quietly dropped out of the world. Hunting big
      game in some wild corner of Nowhere, said rumor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io had revealed to Banneker the truth; her husband was in a sanitarium not
      far from Philadelphia. As she told him, her eyes were dim. Swift, with the
      apprehension of the lover to read the loved one&rsquo;s face, she saw a
      smothered jealousy in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you must pity him, too! He has been so game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This is nearly the end. I shall go down there to be near him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way, Philadelphia,&rdquo; he said moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a child! Two hours in your car from The Retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may come down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May? You must!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still unappeased. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be very far away from me
      most of the time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gleamed on him, her face all joyous for his incessant want of her.
      &ldquo;Stupid! We shall see almost as much of each other as before. I&rsquo;ll
      be coming over to New York two or three times a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherewith, and a promised daily telephone call, he must be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at that meeting did he broach the subject nearest his heart. He felt
      that he must give Io time to adjust herself to the new-developed status of
      her husband, as of one already passed out of the world. A fortnight later
      he spoke out. He had gone down to The Retreat for the week-end and she had
      come up from Philadelphia to meet him, for dinner. He found her in a
      secluded alcove off the main dining-porch, alone. She rose and came to
      him, after that one swift, sweet, precautionary glance about her with
      which a woman in love assures herself of safety before she gives her lips;
      tender and passionate to the yearning need of her that sprang in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, I&rsquo;ve been undergoing a solemn preachment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Densmore here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he came over to Philadelphia to deliver it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so gloomily. It was to be expected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on my mind all the time; the danger to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you end it?&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Too confident to misconstrue his reply, she let her hand fall on his,
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io, how long will it be, with Eyre? Before&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; that!&rdquo; The brilliance faded from her eager loveliness.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps a year. He suffers abominably, poor
      fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after&mdash;after <i>that</i>, how long before you can marry
      me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She twinkled at him mischievously. &ldquo;So, after all these years, my
      lover makes me an offer of marriage. Why didn&rsquo;t you ask me at
      Manzanita?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Would it possibly&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no! I shouldn&rsquo;t have said it. I was teasing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that there&rsquo;s never been a moment when the one thing
      worth living and fighting and striving for wasn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And success?&rdquo; she taunted, but with tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another name for you. I wanted it only as the reflex of your wish
      for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when I&rsquo;d left you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when you&rsquo;d left me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ban!&rdquo; she breathed, and for a moment her fingers
      fluttered at his cheek. &ldquo;Have I made it up to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over the long, low chair in which she half reclined. &ldquo;A
      thousand times! Every day that I see you; every day that I think of you;
      with the lightest touch of your hand; the sound of your voice; the turn of
      your face toward me. I&rsquo;m jealous of it and fearful of it. Can you
      wonder that I live in a torment of dread lest something happen to bring it
      all to ruin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;Nothing could. Unless&mdash;No. I won&rsquo;t
      say it. I want you to want to marry me, Ban. But&mdash;I wonder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As they talked, the little light of late afternoon had dwindled, until in
      their nook they could see each other only as vague forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a table-lamp there?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Turn
      it on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found and pulled the chain. The glow, softly shaded, irradiated Io&rsquo;s
      lineaments, showing her thoughtful, somber, even a little apprehensive.
      She lifted the shade and turned it to throw the direct rays upon Banneker.
      He blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo; she asked softly. Even more softly, she added,
      &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind veered back across the years, full of struggle, of triumph, of
      emptiness, of fulfillment, to a night in another world; a world of dreams,
      magic associations, high and peaceful ambitions, into which had broken a
      voice and an appeal from the darkness. He had turned the light upon
      himself then that she might see him for what he was and have no fear. So
      he held it now, lifting it above his forehead. Hypnotized by the
      compulsion of memory, she said, as she had said to the unknown helper in
      the desert shack:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you. Do I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that. It came back to me, Ban.
      Perhaps it&rsquo;s true. <i>Do</i> I know you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As in the long ago he answered her: &ldquo;Are you afraid of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of everything. Of the future. Of what I don&rsquo;t know in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing of me that you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
      averred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; She was infinitely wistful; avid of
      reassurance. Before he could answer she continued: &ldquo;That night in
      the rain when I first saw you, under the flash, as I see you now&mdash;Ban,
      dear, how little you&rsquo;ve changed, how wonderfully little, to the eye!&mdash;the
      instant I saw you, I trusted you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you trust me now?&rdquo; he asked for the delight of hearing her
      declare it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead he heard, incredulously, the doubt in her tone. &ldquo;Do I? I
      want to&mdash;so much! I did then. At first sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He set down the lamp. She could hear him breathing quick and stressfully.
      He did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first sight,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And&mdash;I think&mdash;I
      loved you from that minute. Though of course I didn&rsquo;t know. Not for
      days. Then, when I&rsquo;d gone, I found what I&rsquo;d never dreamed of;
      how much I could love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, more than then!&rdquo; The low cry leapt from her lips. &ldquo;A
      thousand times more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I, Ban?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;What have you
      done? How have you changed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ve given me your love. Do you
      trust yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered with a startling quietude of certainty.
      &ldquo;In that I do. Absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll chance the rest. You&rsquo;re upset to-night, aren&rsquo;t
      you, Io? You&rsquo;ve let your imagination run away with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a new thing to me. It began&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know when it began. Yes; I do. Before I ever knew or thought of you. Oh,
      long before! When I was no more than a baby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rede me your riddle, love,&rdquo; he said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so silly. You mustn&rsquo;t laugh; no, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      laugh. But you mustn&rsquo;t be angry with me for being a fool. Childhood
      impressions are terribly lasting things, Ban.... Yes, I&rsquo;m going to
      tell you. It was a nurse I had when I was only four, I think; such a
      pretty, dainty Irish creature, the pink-and-black type. She used to cry
      over me and say&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose she thought I would ever
      understand or remember&mdash;&lsquo;Beware the brown-eyed boys, darlin&rsquo;.
      False an&rsquo; foul they are, the brown ones. They take a girl&rsquo;s
      poor heart an&rsquo; witch it away an&rsquo; twitch it away, an&rsquo;
      toss it back all crushed an&rsquo; spoilt.&rsquo; Then she would hug me
      and sob. She left soon after; but the warning has haunted me like a
      superstition.... Could you kiss it away, Ban? Tell me I&rsquo;m a little
      fool!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching footsteps broke in upon them. The square bulk of Jim Maitland
      appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho! you two. Ban, you&rsquo;re scampin&rsquo; your polo
      practice shamefully. You&rsquo;ll be crabbin&rsquo; the team if you don&rsquo;t
      look out. Dinin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Io. &ldquo;Is Marie down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comin&rsquo; presently. How about a couple of rubbers after dinner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To assent seemed the part of tact. Io and Ban went to their corner table,
      reserved for three, the third, Archie Densmore, being a prudent fiction.
      People drifted over to them, chatted awhile, were carried on and away by
      uncharted but normal social currents. It was a tribute to the accepted
      status between them that no one settled into the third chair. The Retreat
      is the dwelling-place of tact. All the conversationalists having come and
      gone, Io reverted over the coffee to the talk of their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t expect you to understand me, can I? Especially as I
      don&rsquo;t understand myself. Don&rsquo;t sulk, Ban, dearest. You&rsquo;re
      so un-pretty when you pout.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused to accept the change to a lighter tone. &ldquo;I understand
      this, Io; that you have begun unaccountably to mistrust me. That hurts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. I&rsquo;d rather hurt myself; a
      thousand times rather. Oh, I will marry you, of course, when the time
      comes! And yet&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange, that deep-seated misgiving! I suppose it&rsquo;s
      my woman&rsquo;s dread of any change. It&rsquo;s been so perfect between
      us, Ban.&rdquo; Her speech dropped to its lowest breath of pure music:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This test for love:&mdash;in every kiss, sealed fast To feel
      the first kiss and forebode the last&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it has been with us; hasn&rsquo;t it, my lover?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it shall always be,&rdquo; he answered, low and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dreamed. &ldquo;How could any man feel what he put in those
      lines?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some woman taught him,&rdquo; said Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw him a fairy kiss. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t we &lsquo;The Voices&rsquo;
      here! You should read to me.... Do you ever wish we were back in the
      desert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be, some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered a little, involuntarily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sense of
      recall, isn&rsquo;t there! Do you still love it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the beginning of the Road to Happiness,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The place where I first saw you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care for many things, though, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many. Only two, vitally. You and the paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a curious reply pregnant of meanings which were to come back upon
      him afterward. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be jealous of that. Not as long as
      you&rsquo;re true to it. But I don&rsquo;t think you care for The Patriot,
      for itself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, it&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s part of you; your
      voice; your power. Because it belongs to you. I wonder if you love me
      mostly for the same reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, the reverse reason. Because I belong so entirely to you that
      nothing outside really matters except as it contributes to you. Can&rsquo;t
      you realize and believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shouldn&rsquo;t be jealous of the paper,&rdquo; she mused,
      ignoring his appeal. Then, with a sudden transition: &ldquo;I like your
      Russell Edmonds. Am I wrong or is there a kind of nobility of mind in him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of mind and soul. You would be the one to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      .............the nobleness that lies Sleeping but never dead in other
      men, Will rise in majesty to meet thine own&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      he quoted, smiling into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever talk over your editorials with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often. He&rsquo;s my main and only reliance, politically.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only politically? Does he ever comment on other editorials? The one
      on Harvey Wheelwright, for instance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker was faintly surprised. &ldquo;No. Why should he? Did you discuss
      that with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed not! I wouldn&rsquo;t discuss that particular editorial with
      any one but you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved uneasily. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you attaching undue importance to a
      very trivial subject? You know that was half a joke, anyway.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Probably I take it too
      seriously. But&mdash;but Harvey Wheelwright came into one of our early
      talks, almost our first about real things. When I began to discover you;
      when &lsquo;The Voices&rsquo; first sang to us. And he wasn&rsquo;t one of
      the Voices, exactly, was he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He? He&rsquo;s a bray! But neither was Sears-Roebuck one of the
      Voices. Yet you liked my editorial on that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adored it! You believed what you were writing. So you made it
      beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could make Harvey Wheelwright beautiful. But, at least, you&rsquo;ll
      admit I made him&mdash;well, appetizing.&rdquo; His face took on a shade.
      &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s labor lost, too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We never did
      run the Wheelwright serial, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the infernal idiot had to go and divorce a perfectly
      respectable, if plain and middle-aged wife, in order to marry a quite
      scandalous Chicago society flapper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What connection has that with the serial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? Wheelwright is the arch-deacon of the eternal
      proprieties and pieties. Purity of morals. Hearth and home. Faithful unto
      death, and so on. Under that sign he conquers&mdash;a million pious and
      snuffy readers, per book. Well, when he gets himself spread in the
      Amalgamated Wire dispatches, by a quick divorce and a hair-trigger
      marriage, puff goes his piety&mdash;and his hold on his readers. We just
      quietly dropped him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his serial was just as good or as bad as before, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not! Not for our purposes. He was a dead wolf with his
      sheep&rsquo;s wool all smeared and spotted. You&rsquo;ll never quite
      understand the newspaper game, I&rsquo;m afraid, lady of my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How brown your eyes are, Ban!&rdquo; said Io.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Politics began to bubble in The Patriot office with promise of hotter
      upheavals to come. The Laird administration had shown its intention of
      diverting city advertising, and Marrineal had countered in the news
      columns by several minor but not ineffective exposures of weak spots in
      the city government. Banneker, who had on the whole continued to support
      the administration in its reform plans, decided that a talk with Willis
      Enderby might clarify the position and accordingly made an evening
      appointment with him at his house. Judge Enderby opened proceedings with
      typical directness of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are <i>you</i> going to turn on us, Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cheerful question,&rdquo; retorted the young man
      good-humoredly, &ldquo;considering that it is you people who have gone
      back on The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were any pledges made on our part?&rdquo; queried Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker replied with some spirit: &ldquo;Am I talking with counsel under
      retainer or with a personal friend?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. I apologize,&rdquo; said the imperturbable Enderby.
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the money loss that counts, so much as the slap in
      the face to the paper. It&rsquo;s a direct repudiation. You must realize
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wholly a novice in politics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am, practically.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much that you can&rsquo;t see what Marrineal would be at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal has not confided in me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor in me,&rdquo; stated the lawyer grimly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      need his confidence to perceive his plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you believe them to be?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No glimmer of a smile appeared on the visage of Judge Enderby as he
      countered, &ldquo;Am I talking with a representative of The Patriot or&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed Banneker. &ldquo;<i>Touché!</i> Assume
      that Marrineal has political ambitions. Surely that lies within the bounds
      of propriety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on how he pushes them. Do you read The Patriot, Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of The Patriot smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you approve its methods in, let us say, the political articles?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no control over the news columns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer my question,&rdquo; said the lawyer with a fine
      effect of patience, long-suffering and milky-mild, &ldquo;if it in any way
      discommodes you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all comes to this,&rdquo; disclosed Banneker. &ldquo;If the
      mayor turns on us, we can&rsquo;t lie down under the whip and we won&rsquo;t.
      We&rsquo;ll hit back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Editorially, I mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. At least the editorials will be a direct method of
      attack, and an honest one. I may assume that much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen anything in the editorial columns of The Patriot
      that would lead you to assume otherwise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answering categorically I would have to say &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer as you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will say,&rdquo; observed the other, speaking with marked
      deliberation, &ldquo;that on one occasion I have failed to see matter
      which I thought might logically appear there and the absence of which
      afforded me food for thought. Do you know Peter McClintick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Has he been talking to you about the Veridian killings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enderby nodded. &ldquo;One could not but contrast your silence on that
      subject with your eloquence against the Steel Trust persecutions,
      consisting, if I recall, in putting agitators in jail for six months.
      Quite wrongly, I concede. But hardly as bad as shooting them down as they
      sleep, and their families with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you would have done in my place, then.&rdquo; Banneker
      stated the case of the Veridian Mills strike simply and fairly. &ldquo;Could
      I turn the columns of his own paper on Marrineal for what was not even his
      fault?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. Absurd, as well,&rdquo; acknowledged the other
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you even criticize Marrineal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The jurist reared his gaunt, straight form up from his chair and walked
      across to the window, peering out into the darkness before he answered
      with a sort of restrained passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God o&rsquo; mercies, Banneker! Do you ask me to judge other men&rsquo;s
      acts, outside the rules of law? Haven&rsquo;t I enough problems in
      reconciling my own conscience to conserving the interests of my clients,
      as I must, in honor, do? No; no! Don&rsquo;t expect me to judge, in any
      matter of greater responsibilities. I&rsquo;m answerable to a small
      handful of people. You&mdash;your Patriot is answerable to a million.
      Everything you print, everything you withhold, may have incalculable
      influence on the minds of men. You can corrupt or enlighten them with a
      word. Think of it! Under such a weight Atlas would be crushed. There was a
      time long ago&mdash;about the time when you were born&mdash;when I thought
      that I might be a journalist; thought it lightly. To-day, knowing what I
      know, I should be terrified to attempt it for a week, a day! I tell you,
      Banneker, one who moulds the people&rsquo;s beliefs ought to have the
      wisdom of a sage and the inspiration of a prophet and the selflessness of
      a martyr.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A somber depression veiled Banneker. &ldquo;One must have the sense of
      authority, too,&rdquo; he said at length with an effort. &ldquo;If that is
      undermined, you lose everything. I&rsquo;ll fight for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an abrupt motion his host reached up and drew the window shade, as it
      might be to shut out a darkness too deep for human penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your public care about whether The Patriot loses the city
      advertising; or even know about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the public. But the other newspapers. They&rsquo;ll know, and
      they&rsquo;ll use it against us.... Enderby, we can beat Bob Laird for
      reelection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a threat,&rdquo; returned the lawyer equably,
      &ldquo;it is made to the wrong person. I couldn&rsquo;t control Laird in
      this matter if I wanted to. He&rsquo;s an obstinate young mule&mdash;for
      which Heaven be praised!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t a threat. It&rsquo;s a declaration of war, if
      you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you can beat us? With Marrineal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal isn&rsquo;t an avowed candidate, is he?&rdquo; evaded
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that you&rsquo;ll see some rapidly evolving activity in
      that quarter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that Laird has developed social tendencies, and is using
      the mayoralty to climb?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A silly story of his enemies,&rdquo; answered Enderby
      contemptuously. &ldquo;Just the sort of thing that Marrineal would
      naturally get hold of and use. In so far as Laird has any social
      relations, they are and always have been with that element which your
      society reporters call &lsquo;the most exclusive circles,&rsquo; because
      that is where he belongs by birth and association.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Russell Edmonds says that social ambition is the only road on which
      one climbs painfully downhill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other paid the tribute of a controlled smile to this. &ldquo;Edmonds?
      A Socialist. He has a gnarled mind. Good, hard-grained wood, though. I
      suppose no man more thoroughly hates and despises what I represent&mdash;or
      what he thinks I represent, the conservative force of moneyed power&mdash;than
      he does. Yet in any question of professional principles, I would trust him
      far; yes, and of professional perceptions, too, I think; which is more
      difficult. A crack-brained sage; but wise. Have you talked over the Laird
      matter with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s for Laird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to Edmonds, Banneker. You can&rsquo;t find a better guide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was desultory talk until the caller got up to go. As they shook
      hands, Enderby said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has any one been tracking you lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not that I&rsquo;ve noticed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a fellow lurking suspiciously outside; heavy-set, dark
      clothes, soft hat. I thought that he might be watching you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a man of Banneker&rsquo;s experience of the open, to detect the
      cleverest of trailing was easy. Although this watcher was sly and careful
      in his pursuit, which took him all the way to Chelsea Village, his every
      move was clear to the quarry, until the door of The House With Three Eyes
      closed upon its owner. Banneker went to bed very uneasy. On whose behoof
      was he being shadowed? Should he warn Io?... In the morning there was no
      trace of the man, nor, though Banneker trained every sharpened faculty to
      watchfulness, did he see him again.... While he was mentally engrossed in
      wholly alien considerations, the solution materialized out of nothing to
      his inner vision. It was Willis Enderby who was being watched, and, as a
      side issue, any caller upon him. That evening a taxi, occupied by a
      leisurely young man in evening clothes, drove through East 68th Street,
      where stood the Enderby house, dim, proud, and stiff. The taxi stopped
      before a mansion not far away, and the young man addressed a heavy-bodied
      individual who stood, with vacant face uplifted to the high moon, as if
      about to bay it. Said the young man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ives wishes you to report to him at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; ejaculated the other, lowering his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the usual place,&rdquo; pursued the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Aw-right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His suspicions fully confirmed, Banneker drove away. It was now Ives&rsquo;s
      move, he remarked to himself, smiling. Or perhaps Marrineal&rsquo;s. He
      would wait. Within a few days he had his opportunity. Returning to his
      office after luncheon, he found a penciled note from Ives on his desk,
      notifying him that Miss Raleigh had called him on the &lsquo;phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inquiring for the useful Ives, Banneker learned that he was closeted with
      Marrineal. Such conferences were regarded in the office as inviolable; but
      Banneker was in uncompromising mood. He entered with no more of
      preliminary than a knock. After giving his employer good-day he addressed
      Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found a note from you on my desk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The message came half an hour ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. On your &lsquo;phone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get into my room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door was open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker reflected. This was possible, though usually he left his door
      locked. He decided to accept the explanation. Later he had occasion to
      revise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged. By the way, on whose authority did you put a shadow
      on Judge Enderby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On mine,&rdquo; interposed Marrineal. &ldquo;Mr. Ives has full
      discretion in these matters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives delivered himself of his pet theory. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all bear
      watching. It may come in handy some day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything we can get.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth could any but an insane man expect to get on Enderby?&rdquo;
      contemptuously asked Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shooting a covert look at his principal, Ives either received or assumed a
      permission. &ldquo;Well, there was some kind of an old scandal, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there?&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s voice was negligent. &ldquo;That
      would be hard to believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard to get hold of in any detail. I&rsquo;ve dug some of it out
      through my Searchlight connection. Very useful line, that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ives ventured a direct look at Banneker, but diverted it from the cold
      stare it encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some woman scrape,&rdquo; he explicated with an effort at airiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker turned a humiliating back on him. &ldquo;The Patriot is beginning
      to get a bad name on Park Row for this sort of thing,&rdquo; he informed
      Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a Patriot matter. It is private.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; exclaimed Banneker in disgust. &ldquo;After all, it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter. You&rsquo;ll have your trouble for your pains,&rdquo;
      he prophesied, and returned to phone Betty Raleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had become of Banneker, Betty&rsquo;s gay and pure-toned voice
      demanded over the wire. Had he eschewed the theater and all its works for
      good? Too busy? Was that a reason also for eschewing his friends? He&rsquo;d
      never meant to do that? Let him prove it then by coming up to see her....
      Yes; at once. Something special to be talked over.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a genuine surprise to Banneker to find that he had not seen the
      actress for nearly two months. Certainly he had not specially missed her,
      yet it was keenly pleasurable to be brought into contact again with that
      restless, vital, outgiving personality. She looked tired and a little
      dispirited and&mdash;for she was of that rare type in which weariness does
      not dim, but rather qualifies and differentiates its beauty&mdash;quite as
      lovely as he had ever seen her. The query which gave him his clue to her
      special and immediate interest was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is Haslett leaving The Patriot?&rdquo; Haslett was the Chicago
      critic transplanted to take Gurney&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? I didn&rsquo;t know. You ought not to mourn his loss, Betty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. At least, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to. Do you
      know who the new critic is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Do you? And how do you? Oh, I suppose I ought to understand
      that, though,&rdquo; he added, annoyed that so important a change should
      have been kept secret from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic directness she replied, &ldquo;You mean Tertius
      Marrineal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty! Your engagement to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as there ever was any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really off? Or have you only quarreled?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I can&rsquo;t imagine myself quarreling with Tertius. He&rsquo;s
      too impersonal. For the same reason, and others, I can&rsquo;t see myself
      marrying him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have considered it, for a time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very profoundly. I don&rsquo;t want to marry a newspaper.
      Particularly such a newspaper as The Patriot. For that matter, I don&rsquo;t
      want to marry anybody, and I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being disposed of, what&rsquo;s the matter with The Patriot?
      It&rsquo;s been treating you with distinguished courtesy ever since
      Marrineal took over charge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has. That&rsquo;s part of his newspaperishness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From our review of your new play I judge that it was written by the
      shade of Shakespeare in collaboration with the ghost of Molière, and that
      your acting in it combines all the genius of Rachel, Kean, Booth, Mrs.
      Siddons, and the Divine Sarah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no laughing matter,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Have you
      seen the play?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll go to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s rotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he cried in mock dismay. &ldquo;What does this
      mean? Our most brilliant young&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m as bad as the play&mdash;almost. The part doesn&rsquo;t
      fit me. It&rsquo;s a fool part.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quarreling with The Patriot because it has tempered justice
      with mercy in your case?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy? With slush. Slathering slush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my aid, Memory! Was it not a certain Miss Raleigh who
      aforetime denounced the ruffian Gurney for that he vented his wit upon a
      play in which she appeared. And now, because&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was. I&rsquo;ve no use for the smart-aleck school of
      criticism. But, at least, what Gurney wrote was his own. And Haslett, even
      if he is an old grouch, was honest. You couldn&rsquo;t buy their opinions
      over the counter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker frowned. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better explain, Betty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Gene Zucker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a worm. A fat, wiggly, soft worm from Boston. But he&rsquo;s
      got an idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a moment.&rdquo; She leaned forward fixing
      him with the honest clarity of her eyes. &ldquo;Ban, if I tell you that I&rsquo;m
      really devoted to my art, that I believe in it as&mdash;as a mission, that
      the theater is as big a thing to me as The Patriot is to you, you won&rsquo;t
      think me an affected little prig, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, Betty. I know you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think you do. But you don&rsquo;t know your own paper.
      Zucker&rsquo;s big idea, which he sold to Tertius Marrineal together with
      his precious self, is that the dramatic critic should be the same
      identical person as the assistant advertising manager in charge of theater
      advertising, and that Zucker should be both.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; snapped Banneker. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Betty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. I quite agree with you. Isn&rsquo;t it complete and
      perfect? Zucker gets his percentage of the advertising revenue which he
      brings in from the theaters. Therefore, will he be kind to those
      attractions which advertise liberally? And less kind to those which fail
      to appreciate The Patriot as a medium? I know that he will! Pay your
      dollar and get your puff. Dramatic criticism strictly up to date.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker looked at her searchingly. &ldquo;Is that why you broke with
      Marrineal, Betty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. No. This Zucker deal came afterward. But I think I had
      begun to see what sort of principles Tertius represented. You and I aren&rsquo;t
      children, Ban: I can talk straight talk to you. Well, there&rsquo;s
      prostitution on the stage, of course. Not so much of it as outsiders
      think, but more than enough. I&rsquo;ve kept myself free of any contact
      with it. That being so, I&rsquo;m certainly not going to associate myself
      with that sort of thing in another field. Ban, I&rsquo;ve made the
      management refuse Zucker admittance to the theater. And he gave the play a
      wonderful send-off, as you know. Of course, Tertius would have him do
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, Banneker walked over and soberly shook the girl&rsquo;s hand.
      &ldquo;Betty, you&rsquo;re a fine and straight and big little person. I&rsquo;m
      proud to know you. And I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself that I can do nothing.
      Not now, anyway. Later, perhaps....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said listlessly. &ldquo;But
      you&rsquo;ll be interested in seeing how the Zucker system works out; a
      half-page ad. in the Sunday edition gets a special signed and illustrated
      feature article, a quarter-page only a column of ordinary press stuff. A
      full page&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;ll offer for that. An
      editorial by E.B. perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Ban. I&rsquo;m sick at heart over it all. Of course, I
      know you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back in his car, Banneker reflected with profound distaste that the
      plan upon which he was hired was not essentially different from the Zucker
      scheme, in Marrineal&rsquo;s intent. He, too, was&mdash;if Marrineal&rsquo;s
      idea worked out&mdash;to draw down a percentage varying in direct ratio to
      his suppleness in accommodating his writings to &ldquo;the best interests
      of the paper.&rdquo; He swore that he would see The Patriot and its
      proprietor eternally damned before he would again alter jot or tittle of
      his editorial expression with reference to any future benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long for Mr. Zucker to manifest his presence to Banneker
      through a line asking for an interview, written in a neat, small hand upon
      a card reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Patriot&mdash;Special Theatrical Features E. Zucker, Representative</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Zucker, being sent for, materialized as a buoyant little person,
      richly ornamented with his own initials in such carefully chosen locations
      as his belt-buckle, his cane, and his cigarettes. He was, he explained,
      injecting some new and profitable novelties into the department of
      dramatic criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; quoth Banneker. &ldquo;I thought that Allan
      Haslett had come on from Chicago to be our dramatic critic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he and the business office didn&rsquo;t hit it off very well,&rdquo;
      said little Zucker carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! And do you hit it off pretty well with the business office?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. It was Mr. Haring brought me on here; I&rsquo;m a
      special departmental manager in the advertising department.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your card would hardly give the impression. It suggests the news
      rather than the advertising side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m both,&rdquo; stated Mr. Zucker, brightly beaming. &ldquo;I
      handle the criticism and the feature stuff on salary, and solicit the
      advertising, on a percentage. It works out fine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one might suppose.&rdquo; Banneker looked at him hard. &ldquo;The
      idea being, if I get it correctly, that a manager who gives you a good,
      big line of advertising can rely on considerate treatment in the dramatic
      column of The Patriot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no bargain to that effect. That wouldn&rsquo;t
      be classy for a big paper like ours,&rdquo; replied the high-if somewhat
      naïve-minded Mr. Zucker. &ldquo;Of course, the managers understand that
      one good turn deserves another, and I ain&rsquo;t the man to roast a
      friend that helps me out. I started the scheme in Boston and doubled the
      theater revenue of my paper there in a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immensely interested,&rdquo; confessed Banneker. &ldquo;But
      what is your idea in coming to me about this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big stuff, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; answered the earnest Zucker. He
      laid a jeweled hand upon the other&rsquo;s knee, and removed it because
      some vestige of self-protective instinct warned him that that was not the
      proper place for it. &ldquo;You may have noticed that we&rsquo;ve been
      running a lot of special theater stuff in the Sunday.&rdquo; Banneker
      nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all per schedule, as worked out by me. An
      eighth of a page ad. gets an article. A quarter page ad. gets a signed
      special by me. Haffa page wins a grand little send-off by Bess Breezely
      with her own illustrations. Now, I&rsquo;m figuring on full pages. If I
      could go to a manager and say: &lsquo;Gimme a full-page ad. for next
      Sunday and I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t get Mr. Banneker to do an
      editorial on the show&rsquo;&mdash;if I could say that, why, nothin&rsquo;
      to it! Nothin&rsquo; at-tall! Of course,&rdquo; he added ruminatively,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to pick the shows pretty careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to write the editorials, too,&rdquo;
      suggested Banneker with baleful mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; admitted the other. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
      know as I could get the swing of your style. You certainly got a style,
      Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this. I&rsquo;ll look over next Sunday&rsquo;s advertising,
      particularly the large ads., and if there is a good subject in any of the
      shows, I&rsquo;ll try to do something about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; enthused the unsuspecting pioneer of business-dramatic
      criticism. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to work with a gentleman like you,
      Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Withdrawing, even more pleased with himself than was his wont, Mr. Zucker
      confided to Haring that the latter was totally mistaken in attributing a
      stand-offish attitude to Banneker. Why, you couldn&rsquo;t ask for a more
      reasonable man. Saw the point at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go making any fool promises on the strength of what
      Banneker said to you,&rdquo; commented Haring.
    </p>
    <p>
      With malign relish, Banneker looked up in the Sunday advertising the
      leading theater display, went to the musical comedy there exploited, and
      presently devoted a column to giving it a terrific and only half-merited
      slashing for vapid and gratuitous indecency. The play, which had been
      going none too well, straightway sold out a fortnight in advance, thereby
      attesting the power of the press as well as the appeal of pruriency to an
      eager and jaded public. Zucker left a note on the editorial desk warmly
      thanking his confrère for this evidence of coöperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was practicing its lesser ironies upon Banneker whilst maturing its
      greater ones.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the regular course of political events, Laird was renominated on a
      fusion ticket. Thereupon the old ring, which had so long battened on the
      corruption or local government, put up a sleek and presentable figurehead.
      Marrineal nominated himself amidst the Homeric laughter of the
      professional politicians. How&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; to get anywhere, they
      demanded with great relish of the joke, when he ain&rsquo;t got any
      organization at-tall! Presently the savor oozed out of that joke.
      Marrineal, it appeared, did have an organization, of sorts; worse, he had
      gathered to him, by methods not peculiarly his own, the support of the
      lesser East-Side foreign language press, which may or may not have
      believed in his protestations of fealty to the Common People, but
      certainly did appreciate the liberality of his political advertising
      appropriation, advertising, in this sense, to be accorded its freest
      interpretation. Worst of all, he had Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s editorials, not upon Marrineal himself (for he was too
      shrewd for that), but upon the cause of which Marrineal was
      standard-bearer, were persuasive, ingenious, forceful, and, to the average
      mind, convincing. Was Banneker himself convinced? It was a question which
      he resolutely refused to follow to its logical conclusion. Of the justice
      of the creed which The Patriot upheld, he was perfectly confident. But did
      Marrineal represent that creed? Did he represent anything but Marrineal?
      Stifling his misgivings, Banneker flung himself the more determinedly into
      the fight. It became apparent that he was going to swing an important
      fraction of the labor vote, despite the opposition of such clear-eyed
      leaders as McClintick. To this extent he menaced the old ring rather than
      the forces of reform, led by Laird and managed by Enderby. On the other
      hand, he was drawing from Laird, in so far as he still influenced the
      voters who had followed The Patriot in its original support of the reform
      movement. That Marrineal could not be elected, both of his opponents
      firmly believed; and in this belief, notwithstanding his claims of
      forthcoming victory, the independent candidate privately concurred. It
      would be enough, for the time, to defeat decisively whichever rival he
      turned his heaviest guns upon in the final onset; that would insure his
      future political prestige. Thus far, in his speeches, he had hit out
      impartially at both sides, denouncing the old ring for its corruption,
      girding at Laird as a fake reformer secretly committed to Wall Street
      through Judge Enderby, corporation lawyer, as intermediary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herein Banneker had refrained from following him. Ever the cat at the hole&rsquo;s
      mouth, the patient lurker, the hopeful waiter upon the event, the
      proprietor of The Patriot forbore to press his editorial chief. He still
      mistrusted the strength of his hold upon Banneker; feared a defiance when
      he could ill afford to meet it. What he most hoped was some development
      which would turn Banneker&rsquo;s heavy guns upon Laird so that, with the
      defeat of the fusion ticket candidate, the public would say, &ldquo;The
      Patriot made him and The Patriot broke him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Laird played into Marrineal&rsquo;s hands. Indignant at what he regarded
      as a desertion of principles by The Patriot, the fusion nominee, in one of
      his most important addresses, devoted a stinging ten minutes to a
      consideration of that paper, its proprietor, and its editorial writer, in
      its chosen role of &ldquo;friend of labor.&rdquo; His text was the
      Veridian strike, his information the version which McClintick furnished
      him; he cited Banneker by name, and challenged him as a prostituted mind
      and a corrupted pen. Though Laird had spoken as he honestly believed, he
      did not have the whole story; McClintick, in his account, had ignored the
      important fact that Marrineal, upon being informed of conditions, had
      actually (no matter what his motive) remedied them. Banneker, believing
      that Laird was fully apprised, as he knew Enderby to be, was outraged.
      This alleged reformer, this purist in politics, this apostle of honor and
      truth, was holding him up to contumely, through half-truths, for a course
      which any decent man must, in conscience, have followed. He composed a
      seething editorial, tore it up, substituted another wherein he made reply
      to the charges, in a spirit of ingenuity rather than ingenuousness, for
      The Patriot case, while sound, was one which could not well be thrown open
      to The Patriot&rsquo;s public; and planned vengeance when the time should
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io, on a brief trip from Philadelphia, lunched with him that week, and
      found him distrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only politics,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
      interested in politics,&rdquo; and, as usual, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk
      about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him that look which was like a smile deep in the shadows of her
      eyes. &ldquo;Ban, do you know the famous saying of Terence?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He quoted the &ldquo;Homo sum.&rdquo; &ldquo;That one?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Now, hear my version: &lsquo;I am a woman; nothing that
      touches <i>my</i> man is alien to my interests.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. But there was a note of gratitude in his voice, almost humble,
      as he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only woman in the world, Io, who can
      quote the classics and not seem a prig.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m beautiful,&rdquo; she retorted
      impudently. &ldquo;<i>Tell</i> me I&rsquo;m beautiful, Ban!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the loveliest witch in the world,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for flattery. Now&mdash;politics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He recounted the Laird charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that wasn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;It was most
      unfair. But I don&rsquo;t believe Bob Laird knew the whole story. Did you
      ask him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him? I certainly did not. You don&rsquo;t understand much about
      politics, dearest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of it from the point of view of the newspaper. If
      you&rsquo;re going to answer him in The Patriot, I should think you&rsquo;d
      want to know just what his basis was. Besides, if he&rsquo;s wrong, I
      believe he&rsquo;d take it back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all the damage has been done. He won&rsquo;t get the chance.&rdquo;
      Banneker&rsquo;s jaw set firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you do now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait my chance, load my pen, and shoot to kill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the editorial before you print it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Miss Meddlesome. But you won&rsquo;t let your ideas of
      fair play run away with you and betray me to the enemy? You&rsquo;re a
      Laird man, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice fell to a caressing half-note. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Banneker woman&mdash;in
      everything. Won&rsquo;t you ever remember that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll never be that. You&rsquo;ll always be Io;
      yourself; remote and unattainable in the deeper sense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> say that?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that I complain. You&rsquo;ve made life a
      living glory for me. Yet&rdquo;&mdash;his face grew wistful&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it&mdash;I&rsquo;m like the
      shepherd in the poem,
    </p>
    <p>
      Still nursing the unconquerable hope, Still clutching the inviolable
      shade.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io, why do I always think in poetry, when I&rsquo;m with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you always to,&rdquo; she said, which was a more than
      sufficient answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io had been back in Philadelphia several days, and had &lsquo;phoned
      Banneker that she was coming over on the following Tuesday, when, having
      worked at the office until early evening, he ran around the corner to
      Katie&rsquo;s for dinner. At the big table &ldquo;Bunny&rdquo; Fitch of
      The Record was holding forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitch was that invaluable type of the political hack-writer, a lackey of
      the mind, instinctively subservient to his paper&rsquo;s slightest
      opinion, hating what it hates, loving what it loves, with the servile
      adherence of a medieval churchman. As The Record was bitter upon reform,
      its proprietor having been sadly disillusioned in youth by a lofty but
      abortive experiment in perfecting human nature from which he never
      recovered, Bunny lost no opportunity to damn all reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine the dirty little snob,&rdquo; he was
      saying, as Banneker entered, &ldquo;creeping and fawning and cringing for
      their favors? Up for membership at The Retreat. Dines with Poultney
      Masters, Jr., at his club. Can&rsquo;t you hear him running home to wifie
      all het up and puffed like a toad, and telling her about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s all this, Bunny?&rdquo; inquired Banneker, who had
      taken in only the last few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our best little society climber, the Honorable Robert Laird,&rdquo;
      returned the speaker, and reverted to his inspirational pen-picture:
      &ldquo;Runs home to wifie and crows, &lsquo;What do you think, my dear!
      Junior Masters called me &lsquo;Bob&rsquo; to-day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash, the murderous quality of the thing bit into Banneker&rsquo;s
      sensitive brain. &ldquo;Junior Masters called me &lsquo;Bob&rsquo; to-day.&rdquo;
      The apotheosis of snobbery! Swift and sure poison for the enemy if
      properly compounded with printer&rsquo;s ink. How pat it fitted in with
      the carefully fostered conception, insisted upon in every speech by
      Marrineal, of the mayor as a Wall Street and Fifth Avenue tool and toady!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what exactly had Bunny Fitch said? Was he actually quoting Laird? If
      so, direct or from hearsay? Or was he merely paraphrasing or perhaps only
      characterizing? There was a dim ring in Banneker&rsquo;s cerebral ear of
      previous words, half taken in, which would indicate the latter&mdash;and
      ruin the deadly plan, strike the poison-dose from his hand. Should he ask
      Fitch? Pin him down to the details?
    </p>
    <p>
      The character-sketcher was now upon the subject of Judge Enderby. &ldquo;Sly
      old wolf! Wants to be senator one of these days. Or maybe governor. A
      receptive&rsquo; candidate! Wah! Pulls every wire he can lay hand on, and
      then waits for the honor to be forced upon him.... Good Lord! It&rsquo;s
      eight o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping a bill on the table he hurried out. Half-minded to stop him,
      Banneker took a second thought. Why should he? His statement had been
      definite. Anyway, he could be called up on the morrow. Dining hastily and
      in deep, period-building thought, Banneker returned to the office, locked
      himself in, and with his own hand drafted the editorial built on that
      phrase of petty and terrific import: &ldquo;Junior Masters called me Bob&rsquo;
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After it was written he would not for the world have called up Fitch to
      verify the central fact. He couldn&rsquo;t risk it. He scheduled the
      broadside for the second morning following.... But there was Io! He had
      promised. Well, he was to meet her at a dinner party at the Forbes&rsquo;s.
      She could see it then, if she hadn&rsquo;t forgotten.... No; that, too,
      was a subterfuge hope. Io never forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to assure the resumption of their debate, the talk of the Forbes
      dinner table turned to the mayoralty fight. Shrewd judges of events and
      tendencies were there; Thatcher Forbes, himself, not the least of them; it
      was the express opinion that Laird stood a very good chance of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless they can definitely pin the Wall Street label on him,&rdquo;
      suggested some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might beat him; it&rsquo;s the only thing that could,&rdquo;
      another opined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugging his withering phrase to his heart, Banneker felt a growing
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but The Patriot&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Forbes
      contemptuously, when she abruptly recalled who was at her table. &ldquo;The
      newspapers are doing their worst, but I think they won&rsquo;t make people
      believe much of it,&rdquo; she amended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Laird really the Wall Street candidate?&rdquo; inquired Esther
      Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parley Welland, Io&rsquo;s cousin, himself an amateur politician, answered
      her: &ldquo;He is or he isn&rsquo;t, according as you look at it. Masters
      and his crowd are mildly for him, because they haven&rsquo;t any objection
      to a decent, straight city government, at present. Sometimes they have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On that principle, Horace Vanney must have,&rdquo; remarked Jim
      Maitland. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fighting Laird, tooth and nail, and certainly
      he represents one phase of Wall Street activity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My revered uncle,&rdquo; drawled Herbert Cressey, &ldquo;considers
      that the present administration is too tender of the working-man&mdash;or,
      rather, working-woman&mdash;when she strikes. Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em
      strike; or, if they do strike, have the police bat &rsquo;em on the head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this administration got to do with Vanney&rsquo;s
      mills? I thought they were in Jersey,&rdquo; another diner asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are, the main ones. But he&rsquo;s backing some of the
      local clothing manufacturers, the sweat-shop lot. They&rsquo;ve been
      having strikes. That interferes with profits. Uncle wants the good old
      days of the night-stick and the hurry-up wagon back. He&rsquo;s even
      willing to spend a little money on the good cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io, seated on Banneker&rsquo;s left, turned to him. &ldquo;Is that true,
      Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumors to that effect,&rdquo; he replied
      evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it put The Patriot in a queer position, to be making
      common cause with an enemy of labor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of Horace Vanney, at all,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just an incident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to write your Laird editorial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All written. I&rsquo;ve got a proof in my pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made as if to hold out her hand; but withdrew it. &ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;The little enclosed porch off the conservatory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amused and confirmatory glances followed them as they withdrew together.
      But there was no ill-natured commentary. So habituated was their own
      special set to the status between them that it was accepted with
      tolerance, even with the good-humored approval with which human nature
      regards a logical inter-attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that you want to plunge into politics, Io?&rdquo;
      Banneker asked, looking down at her as she seated herself in the cushioned
      <i>chaise longue</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mouth smiled assent, but her eyes were intent and serious. He dropped
      the proof into her lap, bending over and kissing her lips as he did so.
      For a moment her fingers interlaced over his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll understand it,&rdquo; she breathed, interpreting into
      his caress a quality of pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had read halfway down the column, she raised to him a startled
      face. &ldquo;Are you sure, Ban?&rdquo; she interrogated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the rest,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She complied. &ldquo;What a terrible power little things have,&rdquo; she
      sighed. &ldquo;That would make me despise Laird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million other people will feel the same way to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? Is it to be published so soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning&rsquo;s issue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban; is it true? Did he say that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it from a man I&rsquo;ve known ever since I came to New
      York. He&rsquo;s reliable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so unlike Bob Laird.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it unlike him?&rdquo; he challenged with a tinge of
      impatience. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he been playing about lately with the
      Junior Masters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to know,&rdquo; she replied quietly, &ldquo;that
      Junior and Bob Laird were classmates and clubmates at college, and that
      they probably always have called each other by their first names?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Have you ever heard them?&rdquo; Angry regret beset him the
      instant the question had passed his lips. If she replied in the
      affirmative&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve never happened to hear them,&rdquo; she admitted;
      and he breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my evidence is certainly more direct than yours,&rdquo; he
      pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban; that charge once made public is going to be unanswerable, isn&rsquo;t
      it? Just because the thing itself is so cheap and petty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ve got the true journalistic sense, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the more reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t print it
      unless you know it to be true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it <i>is</i> true.&rdquo; Almost he had persuaded himself that
      it was; that it must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Olneys are having the Junior Masters to dine this evening. I
      know because I was asked; but of course I wanted to be here, where you
      are. Let me call Junior on the &lsquo;phone and ask him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker flushed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing that one can very well do,&rdquo;
      he said lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ask Junior if he and Bob Laird are old chums and call each
      other by their first names?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly it would sound!&rdquo; He tried to laugh the proposal
      away. &ldquo;In any case, it wouldn&rsquo;t be conclusive. Besides, it&rsquo;s
      too late by this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The forms are closed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t change it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose I could, in an extreme emergency. But, dearest, it&rsquo;s
      all right. Why be so difficult?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t playing the game, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it is. It&rsquo;s playing the game as Laird has elected to
      play it. Did he make inquiries before he attacked us on the Veridian
      strike?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my evidence for this is direct. You&rsquo;ll have to trust me
      and my professional judgment, Io.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, but accepted this, saying, &ldquo;If he <i>is</i> that kind of
      a snob it ought to be published. Suppose he sues for libel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be laughed out of court. Why, what is there libelous in
      saying that a man claims to have been called by his first name by another
      man?&rdquo; Banneker chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ought to be libelous if it isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo;
      asserted Io warmly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair or decent that a newspaper
      can hold a man up as a boot-licker and toady, if he isn&rsquo;t one, and
      yet not be held responsible for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dearest, I didn&rsquo;t make the libel laws. They&rsquo;re
      hard enough as it is.&rdquo; His thought turned momentarily to Ely Ives,
      the journalistic sandbag, and he felt a momentary qualm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      pretend to like everything about my job. One of these days I&rsquo;ll have
      a newspaper of my own, and you shall censor every word that goes in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have the
      time for anything else; not even for being in love with the proprietor.
      Ban,&rdquo; she added wistfully, &ldquo;does it cost a very great deal to
      start a new paper?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Or to buy an old one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have money of my own, you know,&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fondled her hand. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t even a temptation,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was. For a paper of his own was farther away from him than it had
      ever been. That morning he had received his statement from his broker. To
      date his losses on Union Thread were close to ninety thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who shall measure the spreading and seeding potentialities of a
      thistle-down or a catchy phrase? Within twenty-four hours after the
      appearance of Banneker&rsquo;s editorial, the apocryphal boast of Mayor
      Laird to his wife had become current political history. Current? Rampant,
      rather. Messenger boys greeted each other with &ldquo;Dearie, Mr. Masters
      calls me Bob.&rdquo; Brokers on &lsquo;Change shouted across a slow day&rsquo;s
      bidding, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your cute little pet name? Mine&rsquo;s
      Bobbie.&rdquo; Huge buttons appeared with miraculous celerity in the hands
      of the street venders inscribed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Bob but Vote for Marrineal&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly did Judge Enderby come out with a statement to the press, declaring
      the whole matter a cheap and nasty fabrication, and challenging The
      Patriot to cite its authority. The damage already done was irreparable.
      Sighting Banneker at luncheon a few days later, Horace Vanney went so far
      as to cross the room to greet and congratulate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A master-stroke,&rdquo; he said, pressing Banneker&rsquo;s hand
      with his soft palm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to have you with us. Won&rsquo;t
      you call me up and lunch with me soon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At The Retreat, after polo, that Saturday, the senior Masters met Banneker
      face to face in a hallway, and held him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politics is politics. Eh?&rdquo; he grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great game,&rdquo; returned the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think up that &lsquo;call-me-Bob&rsquo; business yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it from a reliable source.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn lie,&rdquo; remarked Poultney Masters equably. &ldquo;Did the
      work, though. Banneker, why didn&rsquo;t you let me know you were in the
      market?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the stock-market? What has that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> know what market I mean,&rdquo; retorted the great man
      with unconcealed contempt. &ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t know is your own
      game. Always seek the highest bidder before you sell, my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that from no man&mdash;&rdquo; began Banneker
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he was sensible of a phenomenon. His angry eyes, lifted to
      Poultney Masters&rsquo;s glistening little beads, were unable to endure
      the vicious amusement which he read therein. For the first time in his
      life he was stared down. He passed on, followed by a low and scornful
      hoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting Willis Enderby while charge and counter-charge still rilled the
      air, Io put the direct query to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Billy, what is the truth about the Laird-Masters story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made up out of whole cloth,&rdquo; responded Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made it up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Comprehension and pity were in his intonation as he replied: &ldquo;Not
      Banneker, I understand. It was passed on to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think him to blame?&rdquo; she cried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exculpate him as readily as that. Such a story,
      considering its inevitable&mdash;I may say its intended&mdash;consequences,
      should never have been published without the fullest investigation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;he had it on what
      he considered good authority?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never even cited his authority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it have been confidential?&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io, do you know his authority? Has he told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enderby&rsquo;s voice was very gentle as he put his next question. &ldquo;Do
      you trust Banneker, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his regard, unflinchingly, but there was a piteous quiver about
      the lips which formed the answer. &ldquo;I have trusted him. Absolutely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; well! I&rsquo;ve seen too much good and bad too inextricably
      mingled in human nature, to judge on part information.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Election day came and passed. On the evening of it the streets were ribald
      with crowds gleefully shrieking! &ldquo;Call me Dennis, wifie. I&rsquo;m
      stung!&rdquo; Laird had been badly beaten, running far behind Marrineal.
      Halloran, the ring candidate, was elected. Banneker did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked back on the incidents of the campaign and its culminating
      event with a sense of self-doubt poisoning his triumph, that which most
      sickened him of his own course was not the overt insult from the financial
      emperor, but the soft-palmed gratulation of Horace Vanney.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ambition is the most conservative of influences upon a radical mind. No
      sooner had Tertius Marrineal formulated his political hopes than there
      were manifested in the conduct of The Patriot strange symptoms of a
      hankering after respectability. Essentially Marrineal was not respectable,
      any more than he was radical. He was simply and singly selfish. But,
      having mapped out for himself a career which did not stop short of a
      stately and deep-porticoed edifice in Washington&rsquo;s Pennsylvania
      Avenue (for his conception of the potential leverage of a great newspaper
      increased with The Patriot&rsquo;s circulation), he deemed it advisable to
      moderate some of the more blatant features, on the same principle which
      had induced him to reform the Veridian lumber mill abuses, lest they be
      brought up to his political detriment later. A long-distance thinker,
      Tertius Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operating through invisible channels and by a method which neither
      Banneker nor Edmonds ever succeeded in fathoming, his influence now began
      to be felt for the better tone of the news columns. They became less
      glaringly sensational. Yet the quality of the news upon which the paper
      specialized was the same; it was the handling which was insensibly
      altered. That this was achieved without adversely affecting circulation
      was another proof, added to those already accumulated, of Marrineal&rsquo;s
      really eminent journalistic capacities. The change was the less obvious,
      because The Patriot&rsquo;s competitors in the Great Three-Ringed Circus
      of Sensation had found themselves being conducted, under that leadership,
      farther along the primrose path of stimulation and salaciousness than they
      had realized, and had already modified their policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even under the new policy, however, The Patriot would hardly have proven,
      upon careful analysis, more decent or self-respecting. But it was less
      obvious; cleverer in avoiding the openly offensive. Capron had been curbed
      in his pictorial orgies. The copy-readers had been supplied with a list of
      words and terms tabooed from the captions. But the influence of Severance
      was still potent in the make-up of the news. While Banneker was relieved
      at the change, he suspected its impermanency should it prove unsuccessful.
      To neither his chief editorial writer nor Russell Edmonds had the
      proprietor so much as hinted at the modification of scheme. His silence to
      these two was part of his developing policy of separating more widely the
      different departments of the paper in order that he might be the more
      quietly and directly authoritative over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men were lunching late at Delmonico&rsquo;s, and talking
      politics, when Edmonds leaned forward in his seat to look toward the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Severance,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The professional infuser of excitements approached walking carefully among
      the tables. His eyes burned in a white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On one of his sprees,&rdquo; diagnosed Banneker. &ldquo;Oh,
      Severance! Sit down here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your p-p-pardon.&rdquo; Severance spoke with marked
      deliberation and delicacy, but with a faint stammer. &ldquo;These not
      b-being office hours, I have not the p-pleasure of your acquaintance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The p-pale rictus of the damned,&rdquo; observed Severance. &ldquo;As
      one damned soul to another, I c-confess a longing for companionship of
      m-my own sort. Therefore I accept your invitation. Waiter, a Scotch
      h-highball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were talking of&mdash;&rdquo; began Banneker, when the newcomer
      broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of m-me. Of me and m-my work. I exult in my w-work. L-like Mr.
      Whitman, I celebrate myself. I p-point with pride. What think you,
      gentlemen, of to-day&rsquo;s paper in honor of which I have t-taken my few
      drinks?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the Territon story,&rdquo; growled Edmonds, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      rotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I thank you for your g-golden opinion. Rotten. Exactly
      as intended.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a woman&rsquo;s good name on trial and sentence it on hearsay
      without appeal or recourse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always the danger of going too far along those lines,&rdquo;
      pointed out Marrineal judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, all-wise Proprietor. The d-danger lies in not going far
      enough. The frightful p-peril of being found dull.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Territon story assays too thin in facts, as we&rsquo;ve put it
      out. If Mrs. Territon doesn&rsquo;t leave her husband now for McLaurin,&rdquo;
      opined Marrineal, &ldquo;we are in a difficult position. I happen to know
      her and I very much doubt&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt not at all, d-doubting Tertius. The very fact of our
      publishing the story will force her hand. It&rsquo;s an achievement, that
      story. No other p-paper has a line of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than one other would touch it, in its present form,&rdquo;
      said Banneker. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too raw.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more virtue to us. I r-regard that story as an inspiration.
      Nobody could have brought it off b-but me. &lsquo;A god, a god their
      Severance ruled,&rsquo;&rdquo; punned the owner of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beelzebub, god of filth and maggots,&rdquo; snarled Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bacchus, god of all true inspiration!&rdquo; cried Severance.
      &ldquo;Waiter, slave of B-Bacchus, where is my Scotch?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Severance, you&rsquo;re going too far along your chosen line,&rdquo;
      declared Banneker bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we must tone down a little,&rdquo; agreed Marrineal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensationalist lifted calmly luminous eyes to his chief. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
      he queried softly. &ldquo;Are you meditating a change? Does the
      journalistic l-lady of easy virtue begin to yearn f-for the paths of
      respectability?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Severance,&rdquo; warned Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the touch of the curb the other flamed into still, white wrath. &ldquo;If
      you&rsquo;re going to be a whore,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;play
      the whore&rsquo;s game. I&rsquo;m one and I know it. Banneker&rsquo;s one,
      but hasn&rsquo;t the courage to face it. You&rsquo;re one, Edmonds&mdash;no,
      you&rsquo;re not; not even that. You&rsquo;re the hallboy that f-fetches
      the drinks&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal had risen. Severance turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I salute you, Madam of our high-class establishment. When you take
      your p-price, you at least look the business in the face. No illusions for
      M-Madam Marrineal.... By the w-way, I resign from the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming, Mr. Edmonds?&rdquo; said Marrineal. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      sign the check for me, will you, Mr. Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone with the disciple of Bacchus and Beelzebub, the editor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better get home, Severance. Come in to-morrow, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m q-quite in earnest about resigning. No further use
      for the damned j-job now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could see why you had any use for it in the first place.
      Was it money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You d-don&rsquo;t see at all. I wanted the m-money for a purpose.
      The purpose was a woman. I w-wanted to keep pace with her and her s-set.
      It was the set to which I rightly belonged, but I&rsquo;d dropped out. I
      thought I p-preferred drink. I didn&rsquo;t after she got hold of me. I
      d-don&rsquo;t know why the d-devil I&rsquo;m telling you all this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Severance,&rdquo; said Banneker honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other raised his glass. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to her,&rdquo; he said. He
      drank. &ldquo;I wish her nothing w-worse than she&rsquo;s got. Her name is&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, Severance,&rdquo; cut in Banneker sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      say anything that you&rsquo;ll regret. Naming of names&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no harm in this, n-now,&rdquo; said Severance
      wearily. &ldquo;Hers is smeared in filth all over our third page. It is
      Maud Territon. What do you think of P-Patriotic journalism, anyway,
      Banneker?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the accession to political control of Halloran and the old ring, the
      influence of Horace Vanney and those whom he represented, became as potent
      as it was secret. &ldquo;Salutary measures&rdquo; had been adopted toward
      the garment-workers; a &ldquo;firm hand&rdquo; on the part of the police
      had succeeded in holding down the strike through the fall and winter; but
      in the early spring it was revived and spread throughout the city, even to
      the doors of the shopping district. In another sense than the geographical
      it was nearing the great department stores, for quiet efforts were being
      made by some of the strike leaders to organize and unionize the underpaid
      salesmen and saleswomen of the shops. Inevitably this drew into active
      hostility to the strikers the whole power of the stores with their immense
      advertising influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very little news of the strike got into the papers except where some clash
      with the police was of too great magnitude to be ignored; then the trend
      of the articles was generally hostile to the strikers. The Sphere
      published the facts briefly, as a matter of journalistic principle; The
      Ledger published them with violent bias, as a matter of journalistic
      habit; the other papers, including The Patriot, suppressed or minimized to
      as great an extent as they deemed feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the troubles of some thousands of sweated wage-earners, employed upon
      classes of machine-made clothing which would never come within the ken of
      the delicately clad women of her world, could in any manner affect Io
      Eyre, was most improbable. But the minor fate who manipulates
      improbabilities elected that she should be in a downtown store at the
      moment when a squad of mounted police charged a crowd of girl-strikers.
      Hearing the scream of panic, she ran out, saw ignorant, wild-eyed girls,
      hardly more than children, beaten down, trampled, hurried hither and
      thither, seized upon and thrown into patrol wagons, and when she reached
      her car, sick and furious, found an eighteen-year-old Lithuanian blonde
      flopping against the rear fender in a dead faint. Strong as a young
      panther, Io picked up the derelict in her arms, hoisted her into the
      tonneau, and bade the disgusted chauffeur, &ldquo;Home.&rdquo; What she
      heard from the revived girl, in the talk which followed, sent her,
      hot-hearted, to the police court where the arrests would be brought up for
      primary judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person that she met there was Willis Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re on this strike case, Cousin Billy,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against you, and I&rsquo;m ashamed of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably aren&rsquo;t the former, and you needn&rsquo;t be the
      latter,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Mr. Vanney&rsquo;s lawyer? And isn&rsquo;t he
      interested in the strike?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not openly. It happens that I&rsquo;m here for the strikers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io stared, incredulous. &ldquo;For the strikers? You mean that they&rsquo;ve
      retained you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m really here in my capacity as President of the
      Law Enforcement Society; to see that these women get the full protection
      of the law, to which they are entitled. There is reason to believe that
      they haven&rsquo;t had it. And you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you willing to go on the stand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; if it will do any good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, so far as the case goes. But it will force it into the
      newspapers. &lsquo;Society Leader Takes Part of Working-Girls,&rsquo; and
      so-on. The publicity will be useful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate on the bench was lenient; dismissed most of the prisoners
      with a warning against picketing; fined a few; sent two to jail. He seemed
      surprised and not a little impressed by the distinguished Mrs. Delavan
      Eyre&rsquo;s appearance in the proceedings, and sent word out to the
      reporters&rsquo; room, thereby breaking up a game of pinochle at its point
      of highest interest. There was a man there from The Patriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      With eager expectation Io, back in her Philadelphia apartment, sent out
      for a copy of the New York Patriot. Greatly to her disgust she found
      herself headlined, half-toned, described; but with very little about the
      occasion of her testimony, a mere mention of the strike and nothing
      whatsoever regarding the police brutalities which had so stirred her
      wrath. Io discovered that she had lost her taste for publicity, in a
      greater interest. Her first thought was to write Banneker indignantly; her
      second to ask explanations when he called her on the &lsquo;phone as he
      now did every noon; her third to let the matter stand until she went to
      New York and saw him. On her arrival, several days later, she went direct
      to his office. Banneker&rsquo;s chief interest, next to his ever-thrilling
      delight in seeing her, was in the part played by Willis Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing in that galley?&rdquo; he wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her explanation he shook his head. Something more than that, he was
      sure. Asking Io&rsquo;s permission he sent for Russell Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a new role for Enderby?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. He&rsquo;s been doing this sort of thing always.
      Usually on the quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that this is far from being on the quiet suggests
      politics, doesn&rsquo;t it? Making up to the labor vote?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth should Cousin Billy care for the labor vote?&rdquo;
      demanded Io. &ldquo;Mr. Laird is dead politically, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Judge Enderby isn&rsquo;t. Mr. Edmonds will tell you that much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough. Enderby is a man to be reckoned with. Particularly if&mdash;&rdquo;
      Edmonds paused, hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo; prompted Banneker. &ldquo;Fire ahead, Pop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Marrineal should declare in on the race for the governorship,
      next fall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without any state organization? Is that probable?&rdquo; asked
      Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in case he should make a combination with the old ring crowd,
      who are, naturally, grateful for his aid in putting over Halloran for
      them. It&rsquo;s quite within the possibilities.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the way The Patriot and Mr. Marrineal himself have flayed the
      ring?&rdquo; exclaimed Io. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible. How could he so
      go back on himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds turned his fine and serious smile upon her. &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal&rsquo;s
      guiding principle of politics <i>and</i> journalism is that the public
      never remembers. If he persuades the ring to nominate him, Enderby is the
      logical candidate against him. In my belief he&rsquo;s the only man who
      could beat him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think, Mr. Edmonds, that Judge Enderby&rsquo;s help
      to the arrested women is a political move?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it would be interpreted by all the
      politicians. Personally, I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His sympathies, professional and personal, are naturally on the
      other side,&rdquo; pointed out Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not yours, surely Ban!&rdquo; cried Io. &ldquo;Yours ought to
      be with them. If you could have seen them as I did, helpless and
      panic-stricken, with the horses pressing in on them&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m with them,&rdquo; warmly retorted Banneker.
      &ldquo;If I controlled the news columns of the paper, I&rsquo;d make
      another Sippiac Mills story of this.&rdquo; No sooner had he said it than
      he foresaw to what reply he had inevitably laid himself open. It came from
      Io&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You control the editorial column, Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a subject to be handled in the news, not the editorials,&rdquo;
      he said hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence that fell was presently relieved by Edmonds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      also being handled in the advertising columns. Have you seen the series of
      announcements by the Garment Manufacturers&rsquo; Association? There are
      four of &rsquo;em now in proof.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t seen them,&rdquo; answered Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re able. But on the whole they aren&rsquo;t as able as
      the strikers&rsquo; declaration in rebuttal, offered us to-day, one-third
      of a page at regular advertising rates, same as the manufacturers&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enderby?&rdquo; queried Banneker quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to detect his fine legal hand in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s face became moody. &ldquo;I suppose Haring refused to
      publish it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Haring&rsquo;s for taking it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said the editor, astonished. &ldquo;I thought
      Haring&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think of Haring as if Haring thought as you and I think. That
      isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; declared Edmonds. &ldquo;Haring&rsquo;s got a
      business mind, straight within its limitations. He accepts this strike
      stuff just as he accepts blue-sky mine fakes and cancer cures in which he
      has no belief, because he considers that a newspaper is justified in
      taking any ad. that is offered&mdash;and let the reader beware. Besides,
      it goes against his grain to turn down real money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it appear in to-morrow&rsquo;s paper?&rdquo; questioned Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably, if it appears at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the &lsquo;if&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Banneker. &ldquo;Since Haring
      has passed it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is also Marrineal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haring sent it to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. The useful and ubiquitous Ives, snooping as usual, came
      upon it. Hence it is now in Marrineal&rsquo;s hands. Likely to remain
      there, I should think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal won&rsquo;t let it be published?&rdquo; asked Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my guess,&rdquo; returned the veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; added Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her eyes of mute appeal fixed on him and read her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Io,&rdquo; he promised quietly. &ldquo;If Mr. Marrineal
      won&rsquo;t print it in advertising, I&rsquo;ll print it as editorial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; Io and Edmonds spoke in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s war,&rdquo; said Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a good cause,&rdquo; declared Io proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cause of the independence of Errol Banneker,&rdquo; said the
      veteran. &ldquo;It was bound to come. Go in and win, son. I&rsquo;ll get
      you a proof of the ad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban!&rdquo; said Io with brightened regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you put something at the head of your column for me, if that
      editorial appears?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Wait! I know. The quotation from the Areopagitica. Is that
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning The Patriot appeared as usual. The first of the
      Manufacturers&rsquo; Association arguments to the public was conspicuously
      displayed. Of the strikers&rsquo; reply&mdash;not a syllable. Banneker
      went to Haring&rsquo;s office; found the business manager gloomy, but
      resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal turned it down. He&rsquo;s got the right. That&rsquo;s
      all there is to it,&rdquo; was his version.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; remarked Banneker, and went home to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the editorial which was to constitute the declaration of Errol
      Banneker&rsquo;s independence went much thinking, and little writing. The
      pronunciamento of the strikers, prefaced by a few words of explanation,
      and followed by some ringing sentences as to the universal right to a fair
      field, was enough. At the top of the column the words of Milton, in small,
      bold print. Across the completed copy he wrote &ldquo;Thursday. Must.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Banneker felt in finer fettle for war than when he awoke that
      Thursday morning. Contrary to his usual custom, he did not even look at
      the copy of The Patriot brought to his breakfast table; he wanted to have
      that editorial fresh to eye and mind when Marrineal called him to account
      for it. For this was a challenge which Marrineal could not ignore. He
      breakfasted with a copy of &ldquo;The Undying Voices&rdquo; propped behind
      his coffee cup, refreshing himself before battle with the delights of
      allusive memory, bringing back the days when he and lo had read and
      discovered together. It was noon when he reached the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the boy at the entrance he learned that Mr. Marrineal had come in.
      Doubtless he would find a summons on his desk. None was there. Perhaps
      Marrineal would come to him. He waited. Nothing. Taking up the routine of
      the day, he turned to his proofs, with a view to laying out his schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top one was his editorial on the strikers&rsquo; cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across it was blue-penciled the word &ldquo;Killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker snatched up the morning&rsquo;s issue. The editorial was not
      there. In its place he read, from the top of the column: &ldquo;And though
      all the winds of doctrine blow&rdquo;&mdash;and so on, to the close of
      Milton&rsquo;s proud challenge, followed by:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would You Let Your Baby Drink Carbolic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the strike editorial had been substituted one of Banneker&rsquo;s
      typical &ldquo;mother-fetchers,&rdquo; as he termed them, very useful in
      their way, and highly approved by the local health authorities. This one
      was on the subject of pure milk. Its association with the excerpt from the
      Areopagitica (which, having been set for a standing head, was not cut out
      by the &ldquo;Killed&rdquo;) set the final touch of irony upon the matter.
      Even in his fury Banneker laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next considered the handwriting of the blue-penciled monosyllable. It
      was not Marrineal&rsquo;s blunt, backhand script. Whose was it? Haring&rsquo;s?
      Trailing the proof in his hand he went to the business manager&rsquo;s
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you kill this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Haring got to his feet, white and shaking. &ldquo;For
      God&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Banneker&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you&mdash;yet. By what right did you do
      it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrineal&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With no further word, Banneker strode to the owner&rsquo;s office, pushed
      open the door, and entered. Marrineal looked up, slightly frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you kill this editorial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal&rsquo;s frown changed to a smile. &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marrineal, did you kill my editorial?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your tone a trifle peremptory, for an employee?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take more than five seconds for me to cease to be an
      employee,&rdquo; said Banneker grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? I trust you&rsquo;re not thinking of resigning. By the way,
      some reporter called on me last week to confirm a rumor that you were
      about to resign. Let me see; what paper? Ah; yes; it wasn&rsquo;t a
      newspaper, at least, not exactly. The Searchlight. I told her&mdash;it
      happened to be a woman&mdash;that the story was quite absurd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the nature of a cold trickle seemed to be flowing between
      Banneker&rsquo;s brain and his tongue. He said with effort, &ldquo;Will
      you be good enough to answer my question?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Mr. Banneker, that was an ill-advised editorial. Or,
      rather, an ill-timed one. I didn&rsquo;t wish it published until we had
      time to talk it over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could have talked it over yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I understood that you were busy with callers yesterday. That
      charming Mrs. Eyre, who, by the way, is interested in the strikers, isn&rsquo;t
      she? Or was it the day before yesterday that she was here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Searchlight! And now Io Eyre! No doubt of what Marrineal meant. The
      cold trickle had passed down Banneker&rsquo;s spine, and settled at his
      knees making them quite unreliable. Inexplicably it still remained to
      paralyze his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re reasonable men, you and I, Mr. Banneker,&rdquo; pursued
      Marrineal in his quiet, detached tones. &ldquo;This is the first time I
      have ever interfered. You must do me the justice to admit that. Probably
      it will be the last. But in this case it was really necessary. Shall we
      talk it over later?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Banneker listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hallway he ran into somebody, who cursed him, and then said, oh, he
      hadn&rsquo;t noticed who it was; Pop Edmonds. Edmonds disappeared into
      Marrineal&rsquo;s office. Banneker regained his desk and sat staring at
      the killed proof. He thought vaguely that he could appreciate the
      sensation of a man caught by an octopus. Yet Marrineal didn&rsquo;t look
      like an octopus.... What did he look like? What was that subtle
      resemblance which had eluded him in the first days of their
      acquaintanceship? That emanation of chill quietude; those stagnant eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had it now! It dated back to his boyhood days. A crawling terror which,
      having escaped from a menagerie, had taken refuge in a pool, and there
      fixed its grip upon an unfortunate calf, and dragged&mdash;dragged&mdash;dragged
      the shrieking creature, until it went under. A crocodile.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reverie was broken by the irruption of Russell Edmonds. An inch of the
      stem of the veteran&rsquo;s dainty little pipe was clenched firmly between
      his teeth; but there was no bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of your pipe?&rdquo; asked Banneker,
      stupefied by this phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve resigned,&rdquo; said Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! I wish I could,&rdquo; muttered Banneker.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Explanations were now due to two people, Io and Willis Enderby. As to Io,
      Banneker felt an inner conviction of strength. Hopeless though he was of
      making his course appear in any other light than that of surrender,
      nevertheless he could tell himself that it was really done for her, to
      protect her name. But he could not tell her this. He knew too well what
      the answer of that high and proud spirit of hers would be; that if their
      anomalous relationship was hampering his freedom, dividing his conscience,
      the only course of honor was for them to stop seeing each other at no
      matter what cost of suffering; let Banneker resign, if that were his
      rightful course, and tell The Searchlight to do its worst. Yes; such would
      be Io&rsquo;s idea of playing the game. He could not force it. He must
      argue with her, if at all, on the plea of expediency. And to her
      forthright and uncompromising fearlessness, expediency was in itself the
      poorest of expedients. At the last, there was her love for him to appeal
      to. But would Io love where she could not trust?... He turned from that
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an alternative subject for consideration, Willis Enderby was hardly
      more assuring and even more perplexing. True, Banneker owed no explanation
      to him; but for his own satisfaction of mind he must have it out with the
      lawyer. He had a profound admiration for Enderby and knew that this was in
      a measure reciprocated by a patent and almost wistful liking, curious in a
      person as reserved as Enderby. He cherished a vague impression that
      somehow Enderby would understand. Or, at least, that he would want to
      understand. Consequently he was not surprised when the lawyer called him
      up and asked him to come that evening to the Enderby house. He went at
      once to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banneker, do you know anything of an advertisement by the striking
      garment-workers, which The Patriot first accepted and afterward refused to
      print?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you at liberty to tell me why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In confidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is implied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Marrineal ordered it killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It was Marrineal himself. The advocate of the Common People!
      The friend of Labor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable campaign material,&rdquo; observed Banneker composedly,
      &ldquo;if it were possible to use it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, of course, it isn&rsquo;t; being confidential,&rdquo;
      Enderby capped the thought. &ldquo;I hear that Russell Edmonds has
      resigned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consequence of the rejected advertisement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sat silent so long that his host began: &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have asked that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you exactly what occurred,&rdquo; said
      Banneker quietly, and outlined the episode of the editorial, suppressing,
      however, Marrineal&rsquo;s covert threat as to Io and The Searchlight.
      &ldquo;And <i>I</i> haven&rsquo;t resigned. So you see what manner of man
      I am,&rdquo; he concluded defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean a coward? I don&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were sure!&rdquo; burst out Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? That&rsquo;s hard, when the soul doesn&rsquo;t know itself. Is
      it money?&rdquo; The crisp, clear voice had softened to a great
      kindliness. &ldquo;Are you in debt, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Yes; I am. I&rsquo;d forgotten. That doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently not.&rdquo; The lawyer&rsquo;s heavy brows went up,
      &ldquo;More serious than money,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker recognized the light of suspicion, comprehension, confirmation in
      the keen and fine visage turned upon him. Enderby continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are matters that can be talked of and other matters
      that can&rsquo;t be talked of. But if you ever feel that you want the
      advice of a man who has seen human nature on a good many sides, and has
      learned not to judge too harshly of it, come to me. The only counsel I
      ever give gratis to those who can pay for it&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled
      faintly&mdash;&ldquo;is the kind that may be too valuable to sell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; said Banneker slowly, &ldquo;why
      you don&rsquo;t think me a yellow dog for not resigning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, in your heart you don&rsquo;t think yourself one. Speaking
      of that interesting species, I suppose you know that your principal is
      working for the governorship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he get the nomination?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly. Unless I can beat him for it. I&rsquo;ll tell you
      privately I may be the opposing candidate. Not that the party loves me any
      too much; but I&rsquo;m at least respectable, fairly strong up-State, and
      they&rsquo;ll take what they have to in order to beat Marrineal, who is
      forcing himself down their throats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant prospect for me,&rdquo; gloomed Banneker. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      have to fight you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and fight,&rdquo; returned the other heartily. &ldquo;It
      won&rsquo;t be the first time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I want you to know that it&rsquo;ll be fair fight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No &lsquo;Junior-called-me-Bob&rsquo; trick this time?&rdquo;
      smiled Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker flushed and winced. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Next
      time I&rsquo;ll be sure of my facts. Good-night and good luck. I hope you
      beat us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned the corner into Fifth Avenue a thought struck him. He made
      the round of the block, came up the side of the street opposite, and met a
      stroller having all the ear-marks of the private detective. To think of a
      man of Judge Enderby&rsquo;s character being continuously &ldquo;spotted&rdquo;
      for the mean design of an Ely Ives filled Banneker with a sick fury. His
      first thought was to return and tell Enderby. But to what purpose? After
      all, what possible harm could Ives&rsquo;s plotting and sneaking do to a
      man of the lawyer&rsquo;s rectitude? Banneker returned to The House With
      Three Eyes and his unceasing work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview with Enderby had lightened his spirit. The older man&rsquo;s
      candor, his tolerance, his clear charity of judgment, his sympathetic
      comprehension were soothing and reassuring. But there was another trouble
      yet to be faced. It was three days since the editorial appeared and he had
      heard no word from Io. Each noon when he called on the long-distance
      &lsquo;phone, she had been out, an unprecedented change from her eager
      waiting to hear the daily voice on the wire. Should he write? No; it was
      too difficult and dangerous for that. He must talk it out with her, face
      to face, when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime there was Russell Edmonds. He found the veteran cleaning out his
      desk preparatory to departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know how it hurts to see you go, Pop,&rdquo; he
      said sadly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your next step?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sphere. They want me to do a special series, out around the
      country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they pretty conservative for your ideas?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmonds, ruminating over a pipe even smaller and more fragile than the one
      sacrificed to his rage and disgust, the day of his resignation, gave
      utterance to a profound truth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference whether a newspaper is radical or
      conservative, Ban, if it tells the truth? That&rsquo;s the whole test and
      touchstone; to give news honestly. The rest will take care of itself.
      Compared to us The Sphere crowd are conservative. But they&rsquo;re
      honest. And they&rsquo;re not afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;re honest, and not afraid&mdash;because they don&rsquo;t
      have to be,&rdquo; said Banneker, in a tone so somber that his friend said
      quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that for you, son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;ve gone wrong, I&rsquo;ve got my punishment before
      me,&rdquo; pursued the other with increased gloom. &ldquo;Having to work
      for Marrineal and further his plans, after knowing him as I know him now&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a refined species of retribution, Pop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; I know. You&rsquo;ve got to stick and wait your chance, and
      hold your following until you can get your own newspaper. Then,&rdquo;
      said Russell Edmonds with the glory of an inspired vision shining in his
      weary eyes, &ldquo;you can tell &rsquo;em all to go to hell. Oh, for a
      paper of our own kind that&rsquo;s really independent; that don&rsquo;t
      care a hoot for anything except to get the news and get it straight, and
      interpret it straight; that don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of anything but
      not being honest!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; said Banneker, spiritlessly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
      use? How do we know we aren&rsquo;t chasing a rainbow? How do we know
      people <i>want</i> an honest paper or would know one if they saw it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, son! Don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; implored the
      veteran. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one heresy for which men in our game are
      eternally damned&mdash;and deserve it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I know it. I don&rsquo;t mean it, Pop. I&rsquo;m not
      adopting Marrineal&rsquo;s creed. Not just yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Marrineal was asking for you this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he? I&rsquo;ll look him up. Perhaps he&rsquo;s going to fire
      me. I wish he would.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; grunted the other, reverting to his task. &ldquo;More
      likely going to raise your salary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As between the two surmises, Edmonds&rsquo;s was the nearer the truth.
      Urbane as always, the proprietor of The Patriot waved his editor to a
      seat, remarking, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll sit down this time,&rdquo; the
      slightly ironical tinge to the final words being, in the course of the
      interview, his only reference to their previous encounter. Wondering dully
      whether Marrineal could have any idea of the murderous hatred which he
      inspired, Banneker took the nearest chair and waited. After some
      discussion as to the policy of the paper in respect to the strike, which
      was on the point of settlement by compromise, Marrineal set his delicate
      fingers point to point and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you about the future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; returned Banneker uncompromisingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ultimate ambition is to own and control a newspaper of your
      own, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal&rsquo;s slow, sparse smile hardly moved his lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      in character that you should. What else is there for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever thought of The Patriot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Banneker straightened in his chair. &ldquo;Is The Patriot in
      the market?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. That isn&rsquo;t what I have in mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly be more explicit?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker, I intend to be the next governor of this State.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might quote a proverb on that point,&rdquo; returned the editor
      unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I might cap your cup-and-lip proverb with another as to
      the effect of money as a stimulus in a horse-race.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubts as to your financial capacity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My organization is building up through the State. I&rsquo;ve got
      the country newspapers in a friendly, not to say expectant, mood. There&rsquo;s
      just one man I&rsquo;m afraid of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Enderby?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he would be an admirable nominee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an individual you are at liberty to hold such opinions as you
      please. As editor of The Patriot&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to support The Patriot candidate and owner. Did you send for
      me to tell me that, Mr. Marrineal? I&rsquo;m not altogether an idiot,
      please remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a friend of Judge Enderby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am, that is a personal, not a political matter. No matter how
      much I might prefer to see him the candidate of the party&rdquo;&mdash;Banneker
      spoke with cold deliberation&mdash;&ldquo;I should not stultify myself or
      the paper by supporting him against the paper&rsquo;s owner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is satisfactory.&rdquo; Marrineal swallowed the affront
      without a gulp. &ldquo;To continue. If I am elected governor, nothing on
      earth can prevent my being the presidential nominee two years later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally appalled and amused by the enormous egotism of the man thus
      suddenly revealed, Banneker studied him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the world,&rdquo; repeated the other. &ldquo;I have the
      political game figured out to an exact science. I know how to shape my
      policies, how to get the money backing I need, how to handle the farmer
      and labor. It may be news to you to know that I now control eight of the
      leading farm journals of the country and half a dozen labor organs.
      However, this is beside the question. My point with you is this. With my
      election as governor, my chief interest in The Patriot ceases. The paper
      will have set me on the road; I&rsquo;ll do the rest. Reserving only the
      right to determine certain very broad policies, I purpose to turn over the
      control of The Patriot to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me!&rdquo; said Banneker, thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided I am elected governor,&rdquo; said Marrineal. &ldquo;Which
      depends largely&mdash;yes, almost entirely&mdash;on the elimination of
      Judge Enderby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you asking me to do?&rdquo; demanded Banneker, genuinely
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely nothing. As my right-hand man on the paper, you are
      entitled to know my plans, particularly as they affect you. I can add that
      when I reach the White House&rdquo;&mdash;this with sublime confidence&mdash;&ldquo;the
      paper will be for sale and you may have the option on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker&rsquo;s brain seemed filled with flashes of light, as he returned
      to his desk. He sat there, deep-slumped in his chair, thinking, planning,
      suspecting, plumbing for the depths of Marrineal&rsquo;s design, and above
      all filled with an elate ambition. Not that he believed for a moment in
      Marrineal&rsquo;s absurd and megalomaniacal visions of the presidency. But
      the governorship; that indeed was possible enough; and that would mean a
      free hand for Banneker for the term. What might he not do with The Patriot
      in that time!... An insistent and obtrusive disturbance to his profound
      cogitation troubled him. What was it that seemed to be setting forth a
      claim to divide his attention? Ah, the telephone. He thrust it aside, but
      it would not be silenced. Well ... what.... The discreet voice of his man
      said that a telegram had come for him. All right (with impatience); read
      it over the wire. The message, thus delivered in mechanical tones, struck
      from his mind the lesser considerations which a moment before had glowed
      with such shifting and troublous glory.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Work, incessant and of savage ardor, now filled Banneker&rsquo;s life.
      Once more he immersed himself in it as assuagement to the emptiness of
      long days and the yearning of longer nights. For, in the three months
      since Delavan Eyre&rsquo;s death, Banneker had seen Io but once, and then
      very briefly. Instead of subduing her loveliness, the mourning garb
      enhanced and enriched it, like a jet setting to a glowing jewel. More
      irresistibly than ever she was
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;............ that Lady Beauty in whose praise The voice and hand
      shake still&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      but there was something about her withdrawn, aloof of spirit, which he
      dared not override or even challenge. She spoke briefly of Eyre, without
      any pretense of great sorrow, dwelling with a kindled eye on that which
      she had found admirable in him; his high and steadfast courage through
      atrocious suffering until darkness settled down on his mind. Her own plans
      were definite; she was going away with the elder Mrs. Eyre to a rest
      resort. Of The Patriot and its progress she talked with interest, but her
      questions were general and did not touch upon the matter of the
      surrendered editorial. Was she purposely avoiding it or had it passed from
      her mind in the stress of more personal events? Banneker would have liked
      to know, but deemed it better not to ask. Once he tried to elicit from her
      some indication of when she would marry him; but from this decision she
      exhibited a covert and inexplicable shrinking. This he might attribute, if
      he chose, to that innate and sound formalism which would always lead her
      to observe the rules of the game; if from no special respect for them as
      such, then out of deference to the prejudices of others. Nevertheless, he
      experienced a gnawing uncertainty, amounting to a half-confessed dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, at the moment of parting, she came to his arms, clung to him, gave
      him her lips passionately, longingly; bade him write, for his letters
      would be all that there was to keep life radiant for her....
    </p>
    <p>
      Through some perverse kink in his mental processes, he found it difficult
      to write to Io, in the succeeding weeks and months, during which she
      devotedly accompanied the failing Mrs. Eyre from rest cure to sanitarium,
      about his work on The Patriot. That interplay of interest between them in
      his editorial plans and purposes, which had so stimulated and inspired
      him, was checked. The mutual current had ceased to flash; at least, so he
      felt. Had the wretched affair of his forfeited promise in the matter of
      the strike announcement destroyed one bond between them? Even were this
      true, there were other bonds, of the spirit and therefore irrefragable, to
      hold her to him; thus he comforted his anxious hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because their community of interest in his work had lapsed, Banneker found
      the savor oozing out of his toil. Monotony sang its dispiriting drone in
      his ears. He flung himself into polo with reawakened vim, and roused the
      hopes of The Retreat for the coming season, until an unlucky spill broke
      two ribs and dislocated a shoulder. Restless in the physical idleness of
      his mending days, he took to drifting about in the whirls and ripples and
      backwaters of the city life, out of which wanderings grew a new series of
      the &ldquo;Vagrancies,&rdquo; more quaint and delicate and trenchant than
      the originals because done with a pen under perfected mastery, without
      losing anything of the earlier simplicity and sympathy. In this work,
      Banneker found relief; and in Io&rsquo;s delight in it, a reflected joy
      that lent fresh impetus to his special genius. The Great Gaines
      enthusiastically accepted the new sketches for his magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever ebbing of fervor from his daily task Banneker might feel, his
      public was conscious of no change for the worse. Letters of commendation,
      objection, denunciation, and hysteria, most convincing evidence of an
      editor&rsquo;s sway over the public mind, increased weekly. So, also, did
      the circulation of The Patriot, and its advertising revenue. Its course in
      the garment strike had satisfied the heavy local advertisers of its
      responsibility and repentance for sins past; they testified, by material
      support, to their appreciation. Banneker&rsquo;s strongly pro-labor
      editorials they read with the mental commentary that probably The Patriot
      had to do that kind of thing to hold its circulation; but it could be
      depended upon to be &ldquo;right&rdquo; when the pinch came. Marrineal
      would see to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the episode of the killed proof, Marrineal had pursued a hands-off
      policy with regard to the editorial page. The labor editorials suited him
      admirably. They were daily winning back to the paper the support of
      Marrineal&rsquo;s pet &ldquo;common people&rdquo; who had been alienated
      by its course in the strike, for McClintick and other leaders had been
      sedulously spreading the story of the rejected strikers&rsquo;
      advertisement. But, it appeared, Marrineal&rsquo;s estimate of the public&rsquo;s
      memory was correct: &ldquo;They never remember.&rdquo; Banneker&rsquo;s
      skillful and vehement preachments against Wall Street, money domination of
      the masses, and the like, went far to wipe out the inherent anti-labor
      record of the paper and its owner. Hardly a day passed that some
      working-man&rsquo;s union or club did not pass resolutions of confidence
      and esteem for Tertius C. Marrineal and The Patriot. It amused Marrineal
      almost as much as it gratified him. As a political asset it was
      invaluable. His one cause of complaint against the editorial page was that
      it would not attack Judge Enderby, except on general political or economic
      principles. And the forte of The Patriot in attack did not consist in
      polite and amenable forensics. Its readers were accustomed to the methods
      of the prize-ring rather than the debating platform. However, Marrineal
      made up for his editorial writer&rsquo;s lukewarmness, by the vigor of his
      own attacks upon Enderby. For, by early summer, it became evident that the
      nomination (and probable election) lay between these two opponents.
      Enderby was organizing a strong campaign. So competent and unbiased an
      observer of political events as Russell Edmonds, now on The Sphere,
      believed that Marrineal would be beaten. Shrewd, notwithstanding his
      egotism, Marrineal entertained a growing dread of this outcome himself.
      Through roundabout channels, he let his chief editorial writer understand
      that, when the final onset was timed, The Patriot&rsquo;s editorial page
      would be expected to lead the charge with the &ldquo;spear that knows no
      brother.&rdquo; Banneker would appreciate that his own interests, almost
      as much as his chief&rsquo;s, were committed to the overthrow of Willis
      Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a happy time for the Editor of The Patriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happiness promised for the near future, however. Wearied of chasing a
      phantom hope of health from spot to spot, the elder Mrs. Eyre had finally
      elected to settle down for the summer at her Westchester place. For
      obvious reasons, Io did not wish Banneker to come there. But she would
      plan to see him in town. Only, they must be very discreet; perhaps even to
      the extent of having a third person dine with them, her half-brother
      Archie, or Esther Forbes. Any one, any time, anywhere, Banneker wrote
      back, provided only he could see her again!
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that she came to town, having arranged to meet Banneker for dinner
      with Esther, fate struck from another and unexpected quarter. Such was
      Banneker&rsquo;s appearance when he came forward to greet her that Io
      cried out involuntarily, asking if he were ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he answered briefly. Then, with a
      forced smile of appeal to the third member, &ldquo;Do you mind, Esther, if
      I talk to Io on a private matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go as near as you like,&rdquo; returned that understanding young
      person promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m consumed with a desire to converse with
      Elsie Maitland, who is dining in that very farthest corner. Back in an
      hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Camilla Van Arsdale,&rdquo; said Banneker as the girl
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard from her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Mindle who looks after my shack there. He says she&rsquo;s
      very ill. I&rsquo;ve got to go out there at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ban!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dearest, and after all these endless weeks of separation.
      But you wouldn&rsquo;t have me do otherwise. Would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;When do you
      start?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At midnight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send my stuff in by wire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell until I get there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, you mustn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said with a changed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go? To Miss Camilla? There&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? If she&rsquo;s seriously ill, she needs a woman, not a man
      with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, Io, you don&rsquo;t even like her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven give you understanding, Ban,&rdquo; she retorted with a
      bewitching pretext of enforced patience. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a woman, and
      she was good to me in my trouble. And if that weren&rsquo;t enough, she&rsquo;s
      your friend whom you love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to let you,&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to let me. I&rsquo;d go, anyway. Get Esther back.
      She must help me pack. Get me a drawing-room if you can. If not, I&rsquo;ll
      take your berth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to leave to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. What would you suppose?&rdquo; She gave him her lustrous
      smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll love it,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;because
      it&rsquo;s partly for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening was consumed for Banneker in writing and wiring,
      arranging reservations through his influence with a local railroad
      official whom he pried loose from a rubber of bridge at his club; while Io
      and Esther, dinnerless except for a hasty box of sandwiches, were back in
      Westchester packing and explaining to Mrs. Eyre. When the three reconvened
      in Io&rsquo;s drawing-room the traveler was prepared for an indefinite
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If her condition is critical I&rsquo;ll wire for you,&rdquo;
      promised lo. &ldquo;Otherwise you mustn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he must make shift to be content; that and a swift clasp of her
      arms, a clinging pressure of her lips, and her soft &ldquo;Good-bye. Oh,
      good-bye! Love me every minute while I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; before the
      tactful Esther Forbes, somewhat miscast in the temporary role of
      Propriety, returned from a conversation with the porter to say that they
      really must get off that very instant or be carried westward to the
      eternal scandal of society which would not understand a triangular
      elopement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loneliness no longer beset Banneker, even though Io was farther separated
      from him than before in the unimportant reckoning of geographical miles;
      for now she was on his errand. He held her by the continuous thought of a
      vital common interest. In place of the former bereavement of spirit was a
      new and consuming anxiety for Camilla Van Arsdale. Io&rsquo;s first
      telegram from Manzanita went far to appease that. Miss Van Arsdale had
      suffered a severe shock, but was now on the road to recovery: Io would
      stay indefinitely: there was no reason for Banneker&rsquo;s coming out for
      the present: in fact, the patient definitely prohibited it: letter
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, when it came, forced a cry, as of physical pain, from Banneker&rsquo;s
      throat. Camilla Van Arsdale was going blind. Some obscure reflex of the
      heart trouble had affected the blood supply of the eyes, and the shock of
      discovering this had reacted upon the heart. There was no immediate
      danger; but neither was there ultimate hope of restored vision. So much
      the eminent oculist whom Io had brought from Angelica City told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your first thought (wrote Io) will be to come out here at once. Don&rsquo;t.
      It will be much better for you to wait until she needs you more; until you
      can spend two or three weeks or a month with her. Now I can help her
      through the days by reading to her and walking with her. You don&rsquo;t
      know how happy it makes me to be here where I first knew you, to live over
      every event of those days. Your movable shack is almost as it used to be,
      though there is no absurd steel boat outside for me to stumble into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you believe it; the new station-agent has a Sears-Roebuck catalogue!
      I borrowed it of him to read. What, oh, what should a sensible person&mdash;yes,
      I am a sensible person, Ban, outside of my love for you&mdash;and I&rsquo;d
      scorn to be sensible about that&mdash;Where was I? Oh, yes; what should a
      sensible person find in these simple words &ldquo;Two horse-power,
      reliable and smooth-running, economical of gasoline,&rdquo; and so on, to
      make her want to cry? Ban, send me a copy of &ldquo;The Voices.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent her &ldquo;The Undying Voices&rdquo; and other books to read, and
      long, impassioned letters, and other letters to be read to Camilla Van
      Arsdale whose waning vision must be spared in every possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour (wrote Io) she sits at the piano and makes her wonderful
      music, and tries to write it down. There I can be of very little help to
      her. Then she will go back into her room and lie on the big couch near the
      window where the young, low pines brush the wall, with Cousin Billy&rsquo;s
      photograph in her hands, and be so deathly quiet that I sometimes get
      frightened and creep up to the door to peer in and be sure that she is all
      right. To-day when I looked in at the door I heard her say, quite softly
      to herself: &ldquo;I shall die without seeing his face again.&rdquo; I had
      to hold my breath and run out into the forest. Ban, I didn&rsquo;t know
      that it was in me to cry so&mdash;not since that night on the train when I
      left you.... This all seems so wicked and wrong and&mdash;yes&mdash;wasteful.
      Think of what these two splendid people could be to each other! She craves
      him so, Ban; just the sound of his voice, a word from him; but she won&rsquo;t
      break her own word. Sometimes I think I shall do it. Write me all you can
      about him, Ban, and send papers: all the political matter. You can&rsquo;t
      imagine what it is to her only to hear about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Banneker had clippings collected, wrote a little daily political
      bulletin for Io; even went out of his way editorially to pay an occasional
      handsome tribute to Judge Enderby&rsquo;s personal character, whilst
      adducing cogent reasons why, as the &ldquo;Wall Street and traction
      candidate,&rdquo; he should be defeated. But his personal opinion,
      expressed for the behoof of his correspondents in Manzanita, was that he
      probably could not be defeated; that his brilliant and aggressive campaign
      was forcing Marrineal to a defensive and losing fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great asset in politics,&rdquo; wrote Banneker to Miss
      Camilla, &ldquo;to have nothing to hide or explain. If we&rsquo;re going
      to be licked, there is no man in the world whom I&rsquo;d as gladly have
      win as Judge Enderby.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, of course, in the manner of one having interesting political
      news of no special import to the receiver of the news, to deliver; and
      quite without suggestion of any knowledge regarding her personal concern
      in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But between the lines of Io&rsquo;s letters, full of womanly pity for
      Camilla Van Arsdale, of resentment for her thwarted and hopeless longing,
      Banneker thought to discern a crystallizing resolution. It would be so
      like Io&rsquo;s imperious temper to take the decision into her own hands,
      to bring about a meeting between the long-sundered lovers, to cast into
      the lonely and valiant woman&rsquo;s darkening life one brief and splendid
      glow of warmth and radiance. For to Io, a summons for Willis Enderby to
      come would be no more than a defiance of the conventions. She knew nothing
      of the ruinous vengeance awaiting any breach of faith on his part, at the
      hands of a virulent and embittered wife; she did not even know that his
      coming would be a specific breach of faith, for Banneker, withheld by his
      promise of secrecy to Russell Edmonds, had never told her. Nor had he
      betrayed to her the espionage under which Enderby constantly moved; he
      shrank, naturally, from adding so ignoble an item to the weight of
      disrepute under which The Patriot already lay, in her mind. Sooner or
      later he must face the question from her of why he had not resigned rather
      than put his honor in pawn to the baser uses of the newspaper and its
      owner&rsquo;s ambitions. To that question there could be no answer. He
      could not throw the onus of it upon her, by revealing to her that the
      necessity of protecting her name against the befoulment of The Searchlight
      was the compelling motive of his passivity. That was not within Banneker&rsquo;s
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, meantime, should be his course? Should he write and warn Io about
      Enderby? Could he make himself explicable without explaining too much?
      After all, what right had he to assume that she would gratuitously
      intermeddle in the disastrous fates of others? A rigorous respect for the
      rights of privacy was written into the rules of the game as she played it.
      He argued, with logic irrefutable as it was unconvincing, that this alone
      ought to stay her hand; yet he knew, by the power of their own yearning,
      one for the other, that in the great cause of love, whether for themselves
      or for Camilla Van Arsdale and Willis Enderby, she would resistlessly
      follow the impulse born and matured of her own passion. Had she not once
      before denied love ... and to what end of suffering and bitter
      enlightenment and long waiting not yet ended! Yes; she would send for
      Willis Enderby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with the insight of love, he read the heart of the loved one.
      Self-interest lifted its specious voice now, in contravention. If she did
      send, and if Judge Enderby went to Camilla Van Arsdale, as Banneker knew
      surely that he would, and if Ely Ives&rsquo;s spies discovered it, the way
      was made plain and peaceful for Banneker. For, in that case, the
      blunderbuss of blackmail would be held to Enderby&rsquo;s head: he must,
      perforce, retire from the race on whatever pretext he might devise, under
      threat of a scandal which, in any case, would drive him out of public
      life. Marrineal would be nominated, probably elected; control of The
      Patriot would pass into Banneker&rsquo;s hands; The Searchlight would thus
      be held at bay until he and Io were married, for he could not really doubt
      that she would marry him, even though there lay between them an
      unexplained doubt and a seeming betrayal; and he could remould the
      distorted and debased policies of The Patriot to his heart&rsquo;s desire
      of an honest newspaper fearlessly presenting and supporting truth as he
      saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this at no price of treachery; merely by leaving matters which were,
      in fact, no concern of his, to the arbitrament of whatever fates might
      concern themselves with such troublous matters; it was just a matter of
      minding his own business and assuming that Io Eyre would do likewise. So
      argued self-interest, plausible, persuasive. He went to bed with the
      argument still unsettled, and, because it seethed in his mind, reached out
      to his reading-stand to cool his brain with the limpid philosophies of
      Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Virginibus Puerisque.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cruellest lies are often told in silence,&rdquo; he read&mdash;the
      very letters of the words seemed to scorch his eyes with prophetic fires.
      &ldquo;A man may have sat in a room for hours and not opened his teeth and
      yet come out of that room a disloyal friend or a vile calumniator. And how
      many loves have perished, because from&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker sprang from his bed, shaking. He dressed himself, consulted his
      watch, wrote a brief, urgent line to Io, after &lsquo;phoning for a taxi;
      carried it to the station himself, assured, though only by a few minutes&rsquo;
      margin, of getting it into the latest Western mail, returned to bed and
      slept heavily and dreamlessly.... Not over the bodies of a loved friend
      and an honored foe would Errol Banneker climb to a place of safety for Io
      and triumph for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mail takes four days to reach Manzanita from New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the hot months The House With Three Eyes had kept its hospitable
      orbs darkened of Saturday nights. Therefore, Banneker was free to spend
      his week-ends at The Retreat, and his Friday and Saturday mail were
      forwarded to the nearest country post-office, whither he sent for it, or
      picked it up on his way back to town. It was on Saturday evening that he
      received the letter from Io, saying that she had written to Willis Enderby
      to come on to Manzanita and let the eyes, for which he had filled life&rsquo;s
      whole horizon since first they met his, look on him once more before
      darkness shut down on them forever. Her letter had crossed Banneker&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he will come,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;He must come. It
      would be too cruel ... and I know his heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight-thirty-six in the evening! And Io&rsquo;s letter to Enderby must
      have reached him in New York that morning. He would be taking the fast
      train for the West leaving at eleven. Banneker sent in a call on the
      long-distance &lsquo;phone for Judge Enderby&rsquo;s house. The
      twelve-minute wait was interminable to his grilling impatience. At length
      the placid tones of Judge Enderby&rsquo;s man responded. Yes; the Judge
      was there. No; he couldn&rsquo;t be disturbed on any account; very much
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Banneker. I must speak to him for just a moment. It&rsquo;s
      vital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry, sir,&rdquo; responded the unmoved voice. &ldquo;But
      Judge Enderby&rsquo;s orders was absloot. Not to be disturbed on any
      account.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him that Mr. Banneker has something of the utmost importance
      to say to him before he leaves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, sir. It&rsquo;d be as much as my place is worth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Raging, Banneker nevertheless managed to control himself. &ldquo;He is
      leaving on a trip to-night, is he not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After some hesitation the voice replied austerely: &ldquo;I believe he is,
      sir. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker cursed Judge Enderby for a fool of rigid methods. It would be his
      own fault. Let him go to his destruction, then. He, Banneker, had done all
      that was possible. He sank into a sort of lethargy, brooding over the
      fateful obstacles which had obstructed him in his self-sacrificing pursuit
      of the right, as against his own dearest interests. He might telegraph Io;
      but to what purpose? An idea flashed upon him; why not telegraph Enderby
      at his home? He composed message after message; tore them up as saying too
      much or too little; ultimately devised one that seemed to be sufficient,
      and hurried to his car, to take it in to the local operator. When he
      reached the village office it was closed. He hurried to the home of the
      operator. Out. After two false trails, he located the man at a church
      sociable, and got the message off. It was then nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.
      He had wasted precious moments in brooding. Well, he had done all and more
      than could have been asked of him, let the event be what it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      His night was a succession of forebodings, dreamed or half-wakeful. Spent
      and dispirited, he rose at an hour quite out of accord with the habits of
      The Retreat, sped his car to New York, and put his inquiry to Judge
      Enderby&rsquo;s man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; the telegram had arrived. In time? No; it was delivered twenty
      minutes after the Judge had left for his train.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sun-lulled into immobility, the desert around the lonely little station of
      Manzanita smouldered and slumbered. Nothing was visibly changed from five
      years before, when Banneker left, except that another agent, a
      disillusioned-appearing young man with a corn-colored mustache, came forth
      to meet the slow noon local, chuffing pantingly in under a bad head of
      alkali-water steam. A lone passenger, obviously Eastern in mien and garb,
      disembarked, and was welcomed by a dark, beautiful, harassed-looking girl
      who had just ridden in on a lathered pony. The agent, a hopeful soul,
      ambled within earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; he heard the man say, with the intensity of a
      single thought, as the girl took his hand. Her reply came, encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As brave as ever. Stronger, a little, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&mdash;the eyes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be able to see you; but not clearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long&mdash;&rdquo; began the man, but his voice broke. He shook
      in the bitter heat as if from some inner and deadly chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can tell. She hoards her sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see me?&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;Have you told her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that wise?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;The shock&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that she suspects; she senses your coming. Her face has the
      rapt expression that I have seen only when she plays. Has had since you
      started. Yet there is no possible way in which she could have learned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very wonderful,&rdquo; said the stranger, in a hushed
      voice. Then, hesitantly, &ldquo;What shall I do, Io?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; came the girl&rsquo;s clear answer. &ldquo;Go to
      her, that is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another horse was led forward and the pair rode away through the
      glimmering heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a silent ride for Willis Enderby and Io. The girl was still a
      little daunted at her own temerity in playing at fate with destinies as
      big as these. As for Enderby, there was no room within his consciousness
      for any other thought than that he was going to see Camilla Van Arsdale
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her before he saw her. The rhythms of a song, a tender and gay
      little lyric which she had sung to crowded drawing-rooms, but for him
      alone, long years past, floated out to him, clear and pure, through the
      clear, pure balm of the forest. He slipped quietly from his horse and saw
      her, through the window, seated at her piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unchanged! To his vision the years had left no impress on her. And Io, at
      his side, saw too and marveled at the miracle. For the waiting woman
      looked out of eyes as clear and untroubled as those of a child, softened
      only with the questioning wistfulness of darkening vision. Suffering and
      fortitude had etherealized the face back to youth, and that mysterious
      expectancy which had possessed her for days had touched the curves of her
      mouth to a wonderful tenderness, the softness of her cheek to a quickening
      bloom. She turned her head slowly toward the door. Her lips parted with
      the pressure of swift, small breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io felt the man&rsquo;s tense body, pressed against her as if for support,
      convulsed with a tremor which left him powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought some one to you, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; she said
      clearly: and in the same instant of speaking, her word was crossed by the
      other&rsquo;s call:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willis!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sightless though she was, as Io knew, for anything not close before her
      eyes, she came to him, as inevitably, as unerringly as steel to the
      magnet, and was folded in his arms. Io heard his deep voice, vibrant
      between desolation and passion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years! My God, fifteen years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Io ran away into the forest, utterly glad with the joy of which she had
      been minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willis Enderby stayed five days at Manzanita; five days of ecstasy, of
      perfect communion, bought from the rapacious years at the price of his
      broken word. For that he was willing to pay any price exacted, asking only
      that he might pay it alone, that the woman of his long and self-denying
      love might not be called upon to meet any smallest part of the debt. She
      walked with him under the pines: he read to her: and there were long hours
      together over the piano. It was then that there was born, out of Camilla
      Van Arsdale&rsquo;s love and faith and coming abnegation, her holy and
      deathless song for the dead, to the noble words of the &ldquo;Dominus
      Illuminatio Mea,&rdquo; which to-day, chanted over the coffins of
      thousands, brings comfort and hope to stricken hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hour of death, after this life&rsquo;s whim, When the heart
      beats low, and the eyes grow dim, And pain has exhausted every limb&mdash;
      The lover of the Lord shall trust in Him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day she told him that they would not meet again. Life had
      given to her all and more than all she had dared ask for. He must go back
      to his work in the world, to the high endeavor that was laid upon him as
      an obligation of his power, and now of their love. He must write her; she
      could not do without that, now; but guardedly, for other eyes than hers
      must read his words to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what it is going to be to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to
      follow your course; to be able to pray for you, fighting. I shall take all
      the papers. And any which haven&rsquo;t your name in shall be burned at
      once! How I shall be jealous even of your public who love and admire you!
      But you have left me no room for any other jealousy....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming back to you,&rdquo; he said doggedly, at the final
      moment of parting. &ldquo;Sometime, Camilla.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be here always, in the darkness, with me. And I shall love
      my blindness because it shuts out anything but you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Io rode with him to the station. On the way they discussed ways and means,
      the household arrangements when Io should have to leave, the finding of a
      companion, who should be at once nurse, secretary, and amanuensis for
      Royce Melvin&rsquo;s music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How she will sing now!&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drew near to the station, she put her hand on his horse&rsquo;s
      bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I do wrong to send for you, Cousin Billy?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her a visage transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t answer,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;I should
      know, anyway. It&rsquo;s her happiness I&rsquo;m thinking of. It can&rsquo;t
      have been wrong to give so much happiness, for the rest of her life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of her life,&rdquo; he echoed, in a hushed accent of
      dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Enderby was getting his ticket, Io waited on the front platform. A
      small, wiry man came around the corner of the station, glanced at her, and
      withdrew. Io had an uneasy notion of having seen him before somewhere. But
      where, and when? Certainly the man was not a local habitant. Had his
      presence, then, any significance for her or hers? Enderby returned, and
      the two stood in the hard morning sunlight beneath the broad sign
      inscribed with the station&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger appeared from behind a freight-car on a siding, and hurried
      up to within a few yards of them. From beneath his coat he slipped a
      blackish oblong. It gave forth a click, and, after swift manipulation, a
      second click. Enderby started toward the snap-shotter who turned and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that man?&rdquo; he asked, whirling upon Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gray veil seemed to her drawn down over his features. Or was it a mist
      of dread upon Io&rsquo;s own vision?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen him before,&rdquo; she answered, groping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory flashed one of its sudden and sure illuminations upon her: a
      Saturday night at The House With Three Eyes; this little man coming in
      with Tertius Marrineal; later, peering into the flowerful corner where she
      sat with Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has something to do with The Patriot,&rdquo; she answered
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could The Patriot know of my coming here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Io. She was deadly pale with a
      surmise too monstrous for utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it into words for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io, did you tell Errol Banneker that you were sending for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the midst of the ruin which he saw closing in upon his career&mdash;that
      career upon which Camilla Van Arsdale had newly built her last pride and
      hope and happiness&mdash;he could feel for the agony of the girl before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have betrayed me!&rdquo; cried Io: but, as she
      spoke, the memory of other treacheries overwhelmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train rumbled in. Enderby stooped and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve
      trusted him once too often.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among his various amiable capacities, Ely Ives included that of ceremonial
      arranger. Festivities were his delight; he was ever on the lookout for
      occasions of celebration: any excuse for a gratulatory function sufficed
      him. Before leaving on his chase to Manzanita, he had conceived the festal
      notion of a dinner in honor of Banneker, not that he cherished any love
      for him since the episode of the bet with Delavan Eyre, but because his
      shrewd foresight perceived in it a closer binding of the editor to the
      wheels of the victorious Patriot. Also it might indirectly redound to the
      political advantage of Marrineal. Put thus to that astute and aspiring
      public servant, it enlisted his prompt support. He himself would give the
      feast: no, on better thought, The Patriot should give it. It would be
      choice rather than large: a hundred guests or so; mainly journalistic, the
      flower of Park Row, with a sprinkling of important politicians and
      financiers. The occasion? Why, the occasion was pat to hand! The
      thousandth Banneker editorial to be published in The Patriot, the date of
      which came early in the following month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Ives himself come to Banneker with any such project, it would have
      been curtly rejected. Ives kept in the background. The proposal came from
      Marrineal, and in such form that for the recipient of the honor to refuse
      it would have appeared impossibly churlish. Little though he desired or
      liked such a function, Banneker accepted with a good grace, and set
      himself to write an editorial, special to the event. Its title was,
      &ldquo;What Does Your Newspaper Mean to You?&rdquo; headed with the
      quotation from the Areopagitica: and he compressed into a single column
      all his dreams and idealities of what a newspaper might be and mean to the
      public which it sincerely served. Specially typed and embossed, it was
      arranged as the dinner souvenir.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day drew near, Banneker had less and less taste for the ovation.
      Forebodings had laid hold on his mind. Enderby had been back for five
      days, and had taken no part whatever in the current political activity.
      Conflicting rumors were in the air. The anti-Marrineal group was obviously
      in a state of confusion and doubt: Marrineal&rsquo;s friends were excited,
      uncertain, expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days Banneker had had no letter from Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first intimation of what had actually occurred came to him just before
      he left the office to dress for the dinner in his honor. Willis Enderby
      had formally withdrawn from the governorship contest. His statement given
      out for publication in next morning&rsquo;s papers, was in the office.
      Banneker sent for it. The reason given was formal and brief; nervous
      breakdown; imperative orders from his physician. The whole thing was
      grisly plain to Banneker, but he must have confirmation. He went to the
      city editor. Had any reporter been sent to see Judge Enderby?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes: Dilson, one of the men frequently assigned to do Marrineal&rsquo;s
      and Ives&rsquo;s special work had been sent to Enderby&rsquo;s on the
      previous day with specific instructions to ask a single question: &ldquo;When
      was the Judge going to issue his formal withdrawal&rdquo;: Yes: that was
      the precise form of the question: not, &ldquo;Was he going to withdraw,&rdquo;
      but &ldquo;When was he,&rdquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge would not answer, except to say that he might have a statement
      to make within twenty-four hours. This afternoon (continued the city
      editor) Enderby, it was understood, had telephoned to The Sphere and asked
      that Russell Edmonds come to his house between four and five. No one else
      would do. Edmonds had gone, had been closeted with Enderby for an hour,
      and had emerged with the brief typed statement for distribution to all the
      papers. He would not say a word as to the interview. Judge Enderby
      absolutely denied himself to all callers. Physician&rsquo;s orders again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker reflected that if the talk between Edmonds and Enderby had been
      what he could surmise, the veteran would hardly attend the dinner in his
      (Banneker&rsquo;s) honor. Honor and Banneker would be irreconcilable
      terms, to the stern judgment of Pop Edmonds. Had they, indeed, become
      irreconcilable terms? It was a question which Banneker, in the turmoil of
      his mind, could not face. On his way along Park Row he stopped and had a
      drink. It seemed to produce no effect, so presently he had another. After
      the fourth, he clarified and enlarged his outlook upon the whole question,
      which he now saw in its entirety. He perceived himself as the victim of
      unique circumstances, forced by the demands of honor into what might seem,
      to unenlightened minds, dubious if not dishonorable positions, each one of
      them in reality justified: yes, necessitated! Perhaps he was at fault in
      his very first judgment; perhaps, had he even then, in his inexperience,
      seen what he now saw so clearly in the light of experience, the deadly
      pitfalls into which journalism, undertaken with any other purpose than the
      simple setting forth of truth, beguiles its practitioners&mdash;perhaps he
      might have drawn back from the first step of passive deception and have
      resigned rather than been a party to the suppression of the facts about
      the Veridian killings. Resigned? And forfeited all his force for
      education, for enlightenment, for progress of thought and belief, exerted
      upon millions of minds through The Patriot?... Would that not have been
      the way of cowardice?... He longed to be left to himself. To think it all
      out. What would Io say, if she knew everything? Io whose silence was
      surrounding him with a cold terror.... He had to get home and dress for
      that cursed dinner!
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal had done the thing quite royally. The room was superb with
      flowers; the menu the best devisable; the wines not wide of range, but
      choice of vintage. The music was by professionals of the first grade,
      willing to give their favors to these powerful men of the press. The
      platform table was arranged for Marrineal in the presiding chair, flanked
      by Banneker and the mayor: Horace Vanney, Gaines, a judge of the Supreme
      Court, two city commissioners, and an eminent political boss. The Masters,
      senior and junior, had been invited, but declined, the latter politely,
      the former quite otherwise. Below were the small group tables, to be
      occupied by Banneker&rsquo;s friends and contemporaries of local
      newspaperdom, and a few outsiders, literary, theatrical, and political.
      When Banneker appeared in the reception-room where the crowd awaited,
      smiling, graceful, vigorous, and splendid as a Greek athlete, the whole
      assemblage rose in acclaim&mdash;all but one. Russell Edmonds, somber and
      thoughtful, kept his seat. His leonine head drooped over his broad
      shirt-bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mallory of The Ledger, bending over him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Ban, Pop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking,&rdquo; gloomed Edmonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s behind that smile? Something frozen. What&rsquo;s the
      matter with him?&rdquo; queried the observant Mallory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be too much dinner if he doesn&rsquo;t look out,&rdquo;
      remarked the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to match cocktails with every
      one that comes up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t make a bit of difference,&rdquo; muttered the veteran.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all steel. Cold steel. Can&rsquo;t touch him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal led the way out of the ante-room to the banquet, escorting
      Banneker. Never had the editor of The Patriot seemed to be more completely
      master of himself. The drink had brightened his eyes, brought a warm flush
      to the sun-bronze of his cheek, lent swiftness to his tongue. He was
      talking brilliantly, matching epigrams with the Great Gaines, shrewdly
      poking good-natured fun at the stolid and stupid mayor, holding his and
      the near-by tables in spell with reminiscences in which so many of them
      shared. Some wondered how he would have anything left for his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the game course was being served, Ely Ives was summoned outside.
      Banneker, whose faculties had taken on a preternatural acuteness, saw,
      when he returned, that his face had whitened and sharpened; watched him
      write a note which he folded and pinned before sending it to Marrineal. In
      the midst of a story, which he carried without interruption, the guest of
      honor perceived a sort of glaze settle over his chief&rsquo;s immobile
      visage; the next moment he had very slightly shaken his head at Ives.
      Banneker concluded his story. Marrineal capped it with another. Ives,
      usually abstemious as befits one who practices sleight-of-hand and brain,
      poured his empty goblet full of champagne and emptied it in long, eager
      draughts. The dinner went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ices were being cleared away when a newspaper man, not in evening
      clothes, slipped in and talked for a moment with Mr. Gordon of The Ledger.
      Presently another quietly appropriated a seat next to Van Cleve of The
      Sphere. The tidings, whatever they were, spread. Then, the important men
      of the different papers gathered about Russell Edmonds. They seemed to be
      putting to him brief inquiries, to which he answered with set face and
      confirming nods. With his quickened faculties, Banneker surmised one of
      those inside secrets of journalism so often sacredly kept, though a
      hundred men know them, of which the public reads only the obvious facts,
      the empty shell. Now and again he caught a quick and veiled glance of
      incomprehension of doubt, of incredulity, cast at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chattered on. Never did he talk more brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coffee. Presently there would be cigars. Then Marrineal would introduce
      him, and he would say to these men, this high and inner circle of
      journalism, the things which he could not write for his public, which he
      could present to them alone, since they alone would understand. It was to
      be his <i>magnum opus</i>, that speech. For a moment he had lost physical
      visualization in mental vision. When again he let his eyes rest on the
      scene before him, he perceived that a strange thing had happened. The
      table at which Van Cleve had sat, with seven others, was empty. In the
      same glance he saw Mr. Gordon rise and quietly walk out, followed by the
      other newspaper men in the group. Two politicians were left. They moved
      close to each other and spoke in whispers, looking curiously at Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      What manner of news could that have been, brought in by the working
      newspaper man, thus to depopulate a late-hour dining-table? Had the world
      turned upside down?
    </p>
    <p>
      Below him, and but a few paces distant, Tommy Burt was seated. When he,
      too, got slowly to his feet, Banneker leaned across the strewn, white
      napery toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Tommy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the star reporter stopped, seemed to turn an answer over in
      his mind, then shook his head, and, with an unfathomable look of
      incredulity and shrinking, went his way. Bunny Fitch followed; Fitch, the
      slave of his paper&rsquo;s conventions, the man without standards other
      than those which were made for him by the terms of his employment, who
      would go only because his proprietors would have him go: and the grin
      which he turned up to Banneker was malignant and scornful. Already the
      circle about Ely Ives, who was still drinking eagerly, had melted away.
      Glidden, Mallory, Gale, Andreas, and a dozen others of his oldest
      associates were at the door, not talking as they would have done had some
      &ldquo;big story&rdquo; broken at that hour, but moving in a chill silence
      and purposefully like men seeking relief from an unendurable atmosphere.
      The deadly suspicion of the truth struck in upon the guest of honor; they,
      his friends, were going because they could no longer take part in honoring
      him. His mind groped, terrified and blind, among black shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrineal, for once allowing discomposure to ruffle his imperturbability,
      rose to check the exodus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen! One moment, if you please. As soon as&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest was lost to Banneker as he beheld Edmonds rear his spare form up
      from his chair a few paces away. Reckless of ceremony now, the central
      figure of the feast rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edmonds! Pop!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The veteran stopped, turning the slow, sad judgment of his eyes upon the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; appealed Banneker. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?
      Tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willis Enderby is dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The query, which forced itself from Banneker&rsquo;s lips, was a
      self-accusation. &ldquo;By his own hand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By yours,&rdquo; answered Edmonds, and strode from the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping, Banneker&rsquo;s fingers encountered a bottle, closed about it,
      drew it in. He poured and drank. He thought it wine. Not until the reeking
      stab of brandy struck to his brain did he realize the error.... All right.
      Brandy. He needed it. He was going to make a speech. What speech? How did
      it begin.... What was this that Marrineal was saying? &ldquo;In view of
      the tragic news.... Call off the speech-making?&rdquo; Not at all! He,
      Banneker, must have his chance. He could explain everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brilliantly, convincingly to his own mind, he began. It was all right;
      only the words in their eagerness to set forth the purity of his motives,
      the unimpeachable rectitude of his standards, became confused. Somebody
      was plucking at his arm. Ives? All right? Ives was a good fellow, after
      all.... Yes: he&rsquo;d go home&mdash;with Ives. Ives would understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way back to The House With Three Eyes he explained himself; any
      fair-minded man would see that he had done his best. Ives was fair-minded;
      he saw it. Ives was a man of judgment. Therefore, when he suggested bed,
      he must be right. Very weary, Banneker was. He felt very, very wretched
      about Enderby. He&rsquo;d explain it all to Enderby in the morning&mdash;no:
      couldn&rsquo;t do that, though. Enderby was dead. Queer idea, that! What
      was it that violent-minded idiot, Pop Edmonds, had said? He&rsquo;d settle
      with Pop in the morning. Now he&rsquo;d go to sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke to utter misery. In the first mail came the letter, now expected,
      from Io. It completed the catastrophe in which his every hope was swept
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried to make myself believe (she wrote) that you could not have
      Betrayed him; that you would not, at least, have let me, who loved you,
      be, unknowingly, the agent of his destruction. But the black record comes
      back to me. The Harvey Wheelwright editorial, which seemed so light a
      thing, then. The lie that beat Robert Laird. The editorial that you dared
      not print, after promising. All of one piece. How could I ever have
      trusted you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Ban, Ban! When I think of what we have been to each other; how gladly,
      how proudly, I gave myself to you, to find you unfaithful! Is that the
      price of success? And unfaithful in such a way! If you had been untrue to
      me in the conventional sense, I think it would have been a small matter
      compared to this betrayal. That would have been a thing of the senses, a
      wound to the lesser part of our love. But this&mdash;Couldn&rsquo;t you
      see that our relation demanded more of faith, of fidelity, than marriage,
      to justify it and sustain it; more idealism, more truth, more loyalty to
      what we were to each other? And now this!
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were I alone that you have betrayed, I could bear my own remorse;
      perhaps even think it retribution for what I have done. But how can I&mdash;and
      how can you&mdash;bear the remorse of the disaster that will fall upon
      Camilla Van Arsdale, your truest friend? What is there left to her, now
      that the man she loves is to be hounded out of public life by
      blackmailers? I have not told her. I have not been able to tell her.
      Perhaps he will write her, himself. How can she bear it! I am going away,
      leaving a companion in charge of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale! One last drop of bitterness in the cup of suffering.
      Neither she nor Io had, of course, learned of Enderby&rsquo;s death, and
      could not for several days, until the newspapers reached them. Banneker
      perceived clearly the thing that was laid upon him to do. He must go out
      to Manzanita and take the news to her. That was part of his punishment. He
      sent a telegram to Mindle, his factotum on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hold all newspapers from Miss C. until I get there, if you have to rob
      mails. E.B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without packing his things, without closing his house, without resigning
      his editorship, he took the next train for Manzanita. Io, coming East, and
      still unaware of the final tragedy, passed him, halfway.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the choir was chanting, over the body of Willis Enderby, the solemn
      glory of Royce Melvin&rsquo;s funeral hymn, the script of which had been
      found attached to his last statement, Banneker, speeding westward, was
      working out, in agony of soul, a great and patient penance, for his own
      long observance, planning the secret and tireless ritual through which
      Camilla Van Arsdale should keep intact her pure and long delayed happiness
      while her life endured.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      A dun pony ambled along the pine-needle-carpeted trail leading through the
      forest toward Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s camp, comfortably shaded against
      the ardent power of the January sun. Behind sounded a soft, rapid padding
      of hooves. The pony shied to the left with a violence which might have
      unseated a less practiced rider, as, with a wild whoop, Dutch Pete came by
      at full gallop. Pete had been to a dance at the Sick Coyote on the
      previous night which had imperceptibly merged itself into the present
      morning, and had there imbibed enough of the spirit of the occasion to
      last him his fifteen miles home to his ranch. Now he pulled up and waited
      for the slower rider to overtake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, Ban!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Pete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the lady gettin&rsquo; on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see much of anythin&rsquo;, huh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: and never will again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! Well, I don&rsquo;t figger out as I&rsquo;d want to live long
      in that fix. How long does the doc give her, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps six months; perhaps a year. She isn&rsquo;t afraid to die;
      but she&rsquo;s hanging to life just as long as she can. She&rsquo;s a
      game one, Pete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long will you be with us, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m likely to be around quite a while yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dutch Pete, thoroughly understanding, reflected that here was another game
      one. But he remarked only that he&rsquo;d like to drop in on Miss K&rsquo;miller
      next time he rode over, with a bit of sage honey that he&rsquo;d saved out
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be glad to see you,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;Only,
      don&rsquo;t forget, Pete; not a word about anything except local stuff.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; agreed Pete with that unquestioning acceptance of
      another&rsquo;s reasons for secrecy which marks the frontiersman. &ldquo;Say,
      Ban,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t much of an advertisement for
      Manzanita as a health resort, yourself. Better have that doc stick his
      head in your mouth and look at your insides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker raised tired eyes and smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo;
      he replied listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to next Saturday&rsquo;s dance at the Coyote; that&rsquo;ll
      put dynamite in your blood,&rdquo; prescribed the other as he spurred his
      horse on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker had no need to turn the dun pony aside to the branch trail that
      curved to the door of his guest; the knowing animal took it by habitude,
      having traversed it daily for a long time. It was six months since
      Banneker had bought him: six months and a week since Willis Enderby had
      been buried. And the pony&rsquo;s rider had in his pocket a letter, of
      date only four days old, from Willis Enderby to Camilla Van Arsdale. It
      was dated from the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion, Albany, New York. Banneker
      had written it himself, the night before. He had also composed nearly a
      column of supposed Amalgamated Wire report, regarding the fight for and
      against Governor Enderby&rsquo;s reform measures, which he would read
      presently to Miss Van Arsdale from the dailies just received. As he
      dismounted, the clear music of her voice called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any mail, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Letter from Albany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me open it myself,&rdquo; she cried jealously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He delivered it into her hands: this was part of the ritual. She ran her
      fingers caressingly over it, as if to draw from it the hidden sweetness of
      her lover&rsquo;s strength, which must still be only half-expressed,
      because the words were to be translated through another&rsquo;s reading;
      then returned it to its real author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it slowly, Ban,&rdquo; she commanded softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having completed the letter, his next process was to run through the
      papers, giving in full any news or editorials on State politics. This was
      a task demanding the greatest mental concentration and alertness, for he
      had built up a contemporary history out of his imagination, and must keep
      all the details congruous and logical. Several times, with that uncanny
      retentiveness of memory developed in the blind, she had all but caught
      him; but each time his adroitness saved the day. Later, while he was at
      work in the room which she had set aside for his daily writing, she would
      answer the letter on the typewriter, having taught herself to write by
      position and touch, and he would take her reply for posting. Her nurse and
      companion, an elderly woman with a natural aptitude for silence and
      discretion, was Banneker&rsquo;s partner in the secret. The third member
      of the conspiracy was the physician who came once a week from Angelica
      City because he himself was a musician and this slowly and courageously
      dying woman was Royce Melvin. Between them they hedged her about with the
      fiction that victoriously defied grief and defeated death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Van Arsdale got up from her couch and walked with confident
      footsteps to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; she said, seating herself and letting her fingers run
      over the keys, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you substitute another word for &lsquo;muffled&rsquo;
      in the third line? It comes on a high note&mdash;upper g&mdash;and I want
      a long, not a short vowel sound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would &lsquo;silenced&rsquo; do?&rdquo; he offered, after
      studying the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautifully. You&rsquo;re a most amiable poet! Ban, I think your
      verses are going to be more famous than my music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never that,&rdquo; he denied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the music that
      makes them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from Mr. Gaines yet about the essays?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s taking them. He wants to print two in each issue
      and call them &lsquo;Far Perspectives.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But, Ban, fine as your work is,
      it seems a terrible waste of your powers to be out here. You ought to be
      in New York, helping the governor put through his projects.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, the doctor won&rsquo;t give me my release.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Presently he must remember to have a coughing spell. He coughed hollowly
      and well, thanks to assiduous practice. This was part of the grim and
      loving comedy of deception: that he had been peremptorily ordered back to
      Manzanita on account of &ldquo;weak lungs,&rdquo; with orders to live in
      his open shack until he had gained twenty pounds. He was gaining, but with
      well-considered slowness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you can, you&rsquo;ll go back and help him, even if I&rsquo;m
      not here to know about it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes: I&rsquo;ll go back to help him when I can,&rdquo; he
      promised, as heartily as if he had not made the same promise each time
      that the subject came up. There was still a good deal of the wistful child
      about the dying woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from that forest hermitage where the two worked, one in serene though
      longing happiness, the other under the stern discipline of loss and
      self-abnegation, had poured, in six short months, a living current of song
      which had lifted the fame of Royce Melvin to new heights: her fame only,
      for Banneker would not use his name to the words that rang with a pure and
      vivid melody of their own. Herein, too, he was paying his debt to Willis
      Enderby, through the genius of the woman who loved him; preserving that
      genius with the thin, lustrous, impregnable fiction of his own making
      against threatening and impotent truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when Banneker had brought her a lyric, alive with the sweetness of
      youth and love in the great open spaces, she had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, shall we call it &lsquo;Io?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would do,&rdquo; he said with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traveling in the tropics.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You try so hard to keep the sadness out of your voice when you
      speak of her,&rdquo; said Camilla sorrowfully. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      always there. Isn&rsquo;t there anything I can do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. There&rsquo;s nothing anybody can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind woman hesitated. &ldquo;But you care for her still, don&rsquo;t
      you, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care! Oh, my God!&rdquo; whispered Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she cares. I know she cared when she was here. Io isn&rsquo;t
      the kind of woman to forget easily. She tried once, you know.&rdquo; Miss
      Van Arsdale smiled wanly. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she ever say anything
      of you in her letters?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little.&rdquo; (Io&rsquo;s letters, passing through Banneker&rsquo;s
      hands were carefully censored, of necessity, to forefend any allusion to
      the tragedy of Willis Enderby, often to the extent of being rewritten
      complete. It now occurred to Banneker that he had perhaps overdone the
      matter of keeping his own name out of them.) &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; she
      continued wistfully, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t quarreled, have you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Camilla. We haven&rsquo;t quarreled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then <i>what</i> is it, Ban? I don&rsquo;t want to pry; you know me
      well enough to be sure of that. But if I could only know before the end
      comes that you two&mdash;I wish I could read your face. It&rsquo;s a
      helpless thing, being blind.&rdquo; This was as near a complaint as he had
      ever heard her utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Io&rsquo;s a rich woman, Miss Camilla,&rdquo; he said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I ask her to marry a jobless, half-lunged derelict?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Have</i> you asked her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban, does she know why you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; she knows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How bitter and desolate your voice sounds when you say that! And
      you want me to believe that she knows and still doesn&rsquo;t come to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m&mdash;ill,&rdquo; he said,
      hating himself for the necessity of pretense with Camilla Van Arsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall tell her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he controverted with finality, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      allow it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose it turned out that this were really the right path for you
      to travel,&rdquo; she said after a pause; &ldquo;that you were going to do
      bigger things here than you ever could do with The Patriot? I believe it&rsquo;s
      going to be so, Ban; that what you are doing now is going to be your true
      success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are you going to preach success to
      me? If ever there was a word coined in hell&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss
      Camilla,&rdquo; he broke off, mastering himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She groped her way to the piano, and ran her fingers over the keys.
      &ldquo;There is work, anyway,&rdquo; she said with sure serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s work, thank God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Work enough there was for him, not only in his writing, for which he had
      recovered the capacity after a long period of stunned inaction, but in the
      constant and unwearied labor of love in building and rebuilding,
      fortifying and extending, that precarious but still impregnable bulwark of
      falsehood beneath whose protection Camilla Van Arsdale lived and was happy
      and made the magic of her song. Illusion! Banneker wondered whether any
      happiness were other than illusion, whether the illusion of happiness were
      not better than any reality. But in the world of grim fact which he had
      accepted for himself was no palliating mirage. Upon him &ldquo;the
      illusive eyes of hope&rdquo; were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Banneker was practicing his elaborate deceptions, Miss Van Arsdale
      had perpetrated a lesser one of her own, which she had not deemed it wise
      to reveal to him in their conversation about Io. Some time before that she
      had written to her former guest a letter tactfully designed to lay a
      foundation for resolving the difficulty or misunderstanding between the
      lovers. In the normal course of events this would have been committed for
      mailing to Banneker, who would, of course, have confiscated it. But, as it
      chanced, it was hardly off the typewriter when Dutch Pete dropped in for a
      friendly call while Banneker was at the village, and took the missive with
      him for mailing. It traveled widely, amassed postmarks and forwarding
      addresses, and eventually came to its final port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn out with the hopeless quest of forgetfulness in far lands, Io Eyre
      came back to New York. It was there that the long pursuit of her by
      Camilla Van Arsdale&rsquo;s letter ended. Bewilderment darkened Io&rsquo;s
      mind as she read, to be succeeded by an appalled conjecture; Camilla Van
      Arsdale&rsquo;s mind had broken down under her griefs. What other
      hypothesis could account for her writing of Willis Enderby as being still
      alive? And of her having letters from him? To the appeal for Banneker
      which, concealed though it was, underlay the whole purport of the writing,
      Io closed her heart, seared by the very sight of his name. She would have
      torn the letter up, but something impelled her to read it again; some hint
      of a pregnant secret to be gleaned from it, if one but held the clue. Hers
      was a keen and thoughtful mind. She sent it exploring through the devious
      tangle of the maze wherein she and Banneker, Camilla Van Arsdale and
      Willis Enderby had been so tragically involved, and as she patiently
      studied the letter as possible guide there dawned within her a glint of
      the truth. It began with the suspicion, soon growing to conviction, that
      the writer of those inexplicable words was not, could not be insane; the
      letter breathed a clarity of mind, an untroubled simplicity of heart, a
      quiet undertone of happiness, impossible to reconcile with the picture of
      a shattered and grief-stricken victim. Yet Io had, herself, written to
      Miss Van Arsdale as soon as she knew of Judge Enderby&rsquo;s death,
      pouring out her heart for the sorrow of the woman who as a stranger had
      stood her friend, whom, as she learned to know her in the close
      companionship of her affliction, she had come to love; offering to return
      at once to Manzanita. To that offer had come no answer; later she had had
      a letter curiously reticent as to Willis Enderby. (Banneker, in his
      epistolary personification of Miss Van Arsdale had been perhaps
      overcautious on this point.) Io began to piece together hints and clues,
      as in a disjected puzzle:&mdash;Banneker&rsquo;s presence in Manzanita&mdash;Camilla&rsquo;s
      blindness.&mdash;Her inability to know, except through the medium of
      others, the course of events.&mdash;The bewildering reticence and hiatuses
      in the infrequent letters from Manzanita, particularly in regard to Willis
      Enderby.&mdash;This calm, sane, cheerful view of him as a living being, a
      present figure in his old field of action.&mdash;The casual mention in an
      early letter that all of Miss Van Arsdale&rsquo;s reading and most of her
      writing was done through the nurse or Banneker, mainly the latter, though
      she was mastering the art of touch-writing on the typewriter. The very
      style of the earlier letters, as she remembered them, was different. And
      just here flashed the thought which set her feverishly ransacking the
      portfolio in which she kept her old correspondence. There she found an
      envelope with a Manzanita postmark dated four months earlier. The typing
      of the two letters was not the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping for some aid in the murk, Io went to the telephone and called up
      the editorial office of The Sphere, asking for Russell Edmonds. Within two
      hours the veteran had come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wanting to see you,&rdquo; he said at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Banneker?&rdquo; she queried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. About The Searchlight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Searchlight? I don&rsquo;t understand, Mr. Edmonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we be open with each other, Mrs. Eyre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely, so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I want to tell you that you need have no fear as to what The
      Searchlight may do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t understand. Why should I fear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scandal&mdash;manufactured, of course&mdash;which The
      Searchlight had cooked up about you and Mr. Banneker before Mr. Eyre&rsquo;s
      death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there was never anything published. I should have heard of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; there wasn&rsquo;t. Banneker stopped it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you knew nothing of this, Mrs. Eyre?&rdquo;
      he said, the wonder in his face answering the bewilderment in hers.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Banneker tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never a word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; ruminated the veteran.
      &ldquo;That would be like Ban&mdash;the old Ban,&rdquo; he added sadly.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Eyre, I loved that boy,&rdquo; he broke out, his stern and
      somber face working. &ldquo;There are times even now when I can scarcely
      make myself believe that he did what he did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; pleaded Io. &ldquo;How did he stop The Searchlight?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By threatening Bussey with an exposé that would have blown him out
      of the water. Blackmail, if you like, Mrs. Eyre, and not of the most
      polite kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; whispered Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He held that old carrion-buzzard, Bussey, up at the muzzle of The
      Patriot as if it were a blunderbuss. It was loaded to kill, too. And then,&rdquo;
      pursued Edmonds, &ldquo;he paid the price. Marrineal got out his little
      gun and held him up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Held Ban up? What for? How could he do that? All this is a riddle
      to me, Mr. Edmonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you really want to know?&rdquo; asked the other with a
      touch of grimness. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be pleasant hearing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to know. Everything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Here&rsquo;s the situation. Banneker points his gun, The
      Patriot, at Bussey. &lsquo;Be good or I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rsquo; he says.
      Marrineal learns of it, never mind how. He points <i>his</i> gun at Ban.
      &lsquo;Be good, or I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rsquo; says he. And there you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was his gun? And why need he threaten Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Mrs. Eyre, about that time things were coming to an
      issue between Ban and Marrineal. Ban was having a hard fight for the
      independence of his editorial page. His strongest hold on Marrineal was
      Marrineal&rsquo;s fear of losing him. There were plenty of opportunities
      open to a Banneker. Well, when Marrineal got Ban where he couldn&rsquo;t
      resign, Ban&rsquo;s hold was gone. That was Marrineal&rsquo;s gun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t he resign?&rdquo; asked Io, white-lipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he quit The Patriot he could no longer hold Bussey, and The
      Searchlight could print what it chose. You see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Io, very low. &ldquo;Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t I
      have seen before!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you, if Ban told you nothing?&rdquo; reasoned Edmonds.
      &ldquo;The blame of the miserable business isn&rsquo;t yours. Sometimes I
      wonder if it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s; if the newspaper game isn&rsquo;t
      just too strong for us who try to play it. As for The Searchlight, I&rsquo;ve
      since got another hold on Bussey which will keep him from making any
      trouble. That&rsquo;s what I wanted to tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what does it matter! What does it matter!&rdquo; she moaned.
      She crossed to the window, laid her hot and white face against the cool
      glass, pressed her hands in upon her temples, striving to think
      connectedly. &ldquo;Then whatever he did on The Patriot, whatever
      compromises he yielded to or&mdash;or cowardices&mdash;&rdquo; she winced
      at the words&mdash;&ldquo;were done to save his place; to save me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; returned the other gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what he&rsquo;s doing now?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand he&rsquo;s back at Manzanita.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. And from what I can make out,&rdquo; she added fiercely,
      &ldquo;he is giving up his life to guarding Miss Van Arsdale from breaking
      her heart, as she will do, if she learns of Judge Enderby&rsquo;s death&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
      she cried, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that! You must forget that
      there was anything said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need. I know all that story,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;That
      is what I couldn&rsquo;t forgive in Ban. That he should have betrayed Miss
      Van Arsdale, his oldest friend. That is the unpardonable treachery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save me,&rdquo; said Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even for that. He owed more to her than to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that he did it!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;To
      use my letter to set spies on Cousin Billy and ruin him&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t
      Ban. It isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did it, and, when it was too late, he tried to stop it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stop it?&rdquo; She looked her startled query at him. &ldquo;How
      do you know that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last week,&rdquo; explained Edmonds, &ldquo;Judge Enderby&rsquo;s
      partner sent for me. He had been going over some papers and had come upon
      a telegram from Banneker urging Enderby not to leave without seeing him.
      The telegram must have been delivered very shortly after the Judge left
      for the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegram? Why a telegram? Wasn&rsquo;t Ban in town?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He was down in Jersey. At The Retreat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; gasped Io. &ldquo;At The Retreat! Then my letter would
      have been forwarded to him there. He couldn&rsquo;t have got it at the
      same time that Cousin Billy got the one I sent him.&rdquo; She gripped
      Russell Edmonds&rsquo;s wrists in fierce, strong hands. &ldquo;What if he
      hadn&rsquo;t known in time? What if, the moment he did know, he did his
      best to stop Cousin Billy from starting, with that telegram?&rdquo;
      Suddenly the light died out of her face. &ldquo;But then how would that
      loathsome Mr. Ives have known that he was going, unless Ban betrayed him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough,&rdquo; returned the veteran. &ldquo;He had a report
      from his detectives, who had been watching Enderby for months.... Mrs.
      Eyre, I wish you&rsquo;d give me a drink. I feel shaky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him to give the order. When she returned, they had both steadied
      down. Carefully, and with growing conviction, they gathered the evidence
      into something like a coherent whole. At the end, Io moaned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one thing I can&rsquo;t bear is that Cousin Billy died,
      believing that of Ban.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself upon the broad lounge, prone, her face buried in her
      arms. The veteran of hundreds of fights, brave and blind, righteous and
      mistaken, crowned with fleeting victories, tainted with irremediable
      errors, stood silent, perplexed, mournful. He walked slowly over to where
      the girl was stretched, and laid a clumsy, comforting hand on her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d cry for me, too,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      too old.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every Saturday the distinguished physician from Angelica City came to
      Manzanita on the afternoon train, spent two or three hours at Camilla Van
      Arsdale&rsquo;s camp, and returned in time to catch Number Seven back. No
      imaginable fee would have induced him to abstract one whole day from his
      enormous practice for any other patient. But he was himself an ardent
      vocal amateur, and to keep Royce Melvin alive and able to give forth her
      songs to the world was a special satisfaction to his soul. Moreover, he
      knew enough of Banneker&rsquo;s story to take pride in being partner in
      his plan of deception and self-sacrifice. He pretended that it was a
      needed holiday for him: his bills hardly defrayed the traveling expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, riding back with Banneker, he meditated a final opinion, and out of
      that opinion came speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Banneker, they ought to give you and me a special niche in the
      Hall of Fame,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rather wan smile touched briefly Banneker&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I believe
      that my ambitions once reached even that far,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reflected upon the implied tragedy of a life, so young, for
      which ambition was already in the past tense, as he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the musical section. We&rsquo;ve got our share in the nearest
      thing to great music that has been produced in the America of our time.
      You and I. Principally you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker made a quick gesture of denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you owe to Camilla Van Arsdale, but you&rsquo;ve
      paid the debt. There won&rsquo;t be much more to pay, Banneker.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Banneker looked up sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The visitor shook his graying head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      performed as near a miracle as it is given to poor human power to perform.
      It can&rsquo;t last much longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A matter of weeks. Not more. Banneker, do you believe in a personal
      immortality?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either. I was thinking.... If it were so; when
      she gets across, what she will feel when she finds her man waiting for
      her. God!&rdquo; He lifted his face to the great trees that moved and
      murmured overhead. &ldquo;How that heart of hers has sung to him all these
      years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his voice and sent it rolling through the cathedral aisles of
      the forest, in the superb finale of the last hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For even the purest delight may pall, And power must fail, and the
      pride must fall And the love of the dearest friends grow small&mdash; But
      the glory of the Lord is all in all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The great voice was lost in the sighing of the winds. They rode on,
      thoughtful and speechless. When the physician turned to his companion
      again, it was with a brisk change of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll consider you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to consider,&rdquo; declared Banneker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your professional judgment better than mine?&rdquo; retorted the
      other. &ldquo;How much weight have you lost since you&rsquo;ve been out
      here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out. Don&rsquo;t sleep very well, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not specially.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do at night when you can&rsquo;t sleep? Work?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor uttered a non-professional monosyllable. &ldquo;What will you
      do,&rdquo; he propounded, waving his arm back along the trail toward the
      Van Arsdale camp, &ldquo;when this little game of yours is played out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Banneker. It suddenly struck him that life
      would be blank, empty of interest or purpose, when Camilla Van Arsdale
      died, when there was no longer the absorbing necessity to preserve, intact
      and impregnable, the fortress of love and lies wherewith he had surrounded
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When this chapter is finished,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you
      come down to Angelica City with me. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll go on a little
      camping trip together. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The train carried him away. Oppressed and thoughtful, Banneker walked
      slowly across the blazing, cactus-set open toward his shack. There was
      still the simple housekeeping work to be done, for he had left early that
      morning. He felt suddenly spiritless, flaccid, too inert even for the
      little tasks before him. The physician&rsquo;s pronouncement had taken the
      strength from him. Of course he had known that it couldn&rsquo;t be very
      long&mdash;but only a few weeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost at the shack when he noticed that the door stood half ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, where everything had been disorder, was now order. The bed was
      made, the few utensils washed, polished, and hung up; on the table a
      handful of the alamo&rsquo;s bright leaves in a vase gave a touch of
      color.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the long chair (7 T 4031 of the Sears-Roebuck catalogue) sat Io. A book
      lay on her lap, the book of &ldquo;The Undying Voices.&rdquo; Her eyes
      were closed. Banneker reached out a hand to the door lintel for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light tremor ran through Io&rsquo;s body. She opened her eyes, and fixed
      them on Banneker. She rose slowly. The book fell to the floor and lay open
      between them. Io stood, her arms hanging straitly at her side, her whole
      face a lovely and loving plea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Ban!&rdquo; she said, in a voice so little that it hardly
      came to his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speech and motion were denied him, in the great, the incredible surprise
      of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Ban, forgive me.&rdquo; She was like a child, beseeching.
      Her firm little chin quivered. Two great, soft, lustrous tears welled up
      from the shadowy depths of the eyes and hung, gleaming, above the lashes.
      &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you going to speak to me!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that the bonds of his languor were rent. He leapt to her, heard the
      broken music of her sob, felt her arms close about him, her lips seek his
      and cling, loath to relinquish them even for the passionate murmurs of her
      love and longing for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold me close, Ban! Don&rsquo;t ever let me go again! Don&rsquo;t
      ever let me doubt again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at length, she gently released herself, her foot brushed the fallen
      book. She picked it up tenderly, and caressed its leaves as she adjusted
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the Voices tell you that I&rsquo;d come back, Ban?&rdquo;
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;If they did, I couldn&rsquo;t hear them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they sang to you,&rdquo; she insisted gently. &ldquo;They never
      stopped singing, did they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No. They never stopped singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; then you ought to have known, Ban. And I ought to have known
      that you couldn&rsquo;t have done what I believed you had. Are you sure
      you forgive me, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him of what she had discovered, of the talk with Russell Edmonds
      (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a letter from him for you, dearest one; he loves you,
      too. But not as I do. Nobody could!&rdquo; interjected Io jealously), of
      the clue of the telegram. And he told her of Camilla Van Arsdale and the
      long deception; and at that, for the first time since he knew her, she
      broke down and gave herself up utterly to tears, as much for him as for
      the friend whom he had so loyally loved and served. When it was over and
      she had regained command of herself, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you must take me to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So once more they rode together into the murmurous peace of the forest. Io
      leaned in her saddle as they drew near the cabin, to lay a hand on her
      lover&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, a thousand years ago, Ban,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when love
      came to me, I was a wicked little infidel and would not believe. Not in
      the Enchanted Canyon, nor in the Mountains of Fulfillment, nor in the
      Fadeless Gardens where the Undying Voices sing. Do you remember?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not!&rdquo; whispered Ban, turning to kiss the fingers that
      tightened on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and I blasphemed and said there was always a serpent in
      every Paradise, and that Experience was a horrid hag, with a bony finger
      pointing to the snake.... This is my recantation, Ban. I know now that you
      were the true Prophet; that Experience has shining wings and eyes that can
      lock to the future as well as the past, and immortal Hope for a lover. And
      that only they two can guide to the Mountains of Fulfillment. Is it
      enough, Ban?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; he answered with grave happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Io.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of song, tender and passionate and triumphant, came pulsing
      through the silence to meet them as they rode on.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
